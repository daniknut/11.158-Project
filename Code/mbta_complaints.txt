Title: The new MBTA Ride software is a total disaster...

Every driver I've asked hates the new software, and I've also heard complaints
from MULTIPLE RIDE customers about it. The main complaint is how rides are
scheduled, passengers being picked up earlier than expected and possibly having
to spend an extra 30-45 minutes in a RIDE vehicle.   It's too late for the RIDE
to go back to the old software (ADEPT) and of note, the majority of RIDE drivers
and passengers wanted to replace ADEPT with Spare.

Title: Commuter Rail Extension to Milford (Map)

I saw a post about extending the commuter rail to Milford (here’s a
[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbta/comments/1o5hwj2/commuter_rail_extension_to_milford/)),
so here’s the route to Milford for those that are curious.  Also, I could see an
extension being more feasible once the BEMUs are rolled out. Noise is a common
complaint amongst communities that don’t yet have transit, so having quiet BEMUs
will be crucial.

Title: Feds eye South Station takeover over ‘crime.’ But crime there is actually low (Globe)

[Link to Globe story
here.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/03/data/boston-south-station-crime/)
Last week, [Deputy Transportation Secretary Steven Bradbury
hinted](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/28/metro/governor-healey-slams-trump-south-station-takeover/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)
that the federal government could take over Boston’s South Station as it did at
Union Station in Washington, D.C., citing crime and safety concerns.  But a
Globe analysis of police incident data and resident complaints shows that crime
at Boston’s bustling transit hub is relatively minimal, especially in contrast
to other major hubs like D.C.’s Union Station.  Transit Police statistics show
that there have so far been 22 violent or property crime incidents in 2025 at
the station, which is down 16 percent compared with data from the same time
period last year. Most of those incidents involved larceny.  Boston police,
meanwhile, logged four assault incidents by the close of August, the same number
as last year.  In either case, the volume of crime at South Station is largely
unremarkable, particularly compared with D.C.  While violent crime remains
minimal, resident complaints to the city’s 311 line show that some common
nuisances persist.  The most commonly reported issues involved stalled vehicles
and discarded needles. There were also 15 complaints about encampments in the
area since 2023.

Hi all,  I swear this is 99.9% curiosity and only 0.01% complaint.  The bus
stops by me lost the inbound sign during a winter storm and the outbound sign
leapt in front of a car that jumped the curb a few months ago. Naturally, both
sides are now constantly have parking vultures circling. Both have open 311
tickets marked as referred to the MBTA from right after they went down.  Does
anyone know how long these usually take to get replaced? Or anyone have a
sign/signs replaced recently and remember how long it took? Thanks!  Edit: In
Boston.

Title: Stupid elevator smell QR code scheme. I’m mad.

As a frequenter of this subreddit I don’t take kindly to T-bashing, assumptions
that problems could be easily remedied but MBTA staff are too lazy or stupid ,
don’t care etc - I’ve learned quite the opposite is usually true.  However I
would really like to know who approved this most ridiculous , feeble, incoherent
scheme to put the QR codes inside of these wretched, disgusting elevators ,
thinking that while holding their noses and bracing to jump out asap, that
riders would take the time to a) read a sign on the wall b) spend extra time to
take out their phone and scan the QR code to c) provide feedback voluntarily,
without direct incentive?! I would like to see how ma y people are completing
these surveys, how often, because I truly hope I’m wrong - seems like the
urination in elevators, like the city of Paris, has proved difficult to fix.
It’s almost every MBTA elevator I use in the system.   I’m livid because they’re
doing something about this, have come so close to a viable scheme , and yet it
didn’t dawn on anyone how stupid this is! T pays $21ish/hr to have Transit
Ambasaadors in station , and they’re required to do a “station check” every 20
mins and note issues on their tablets which are for sure internet connected .
The IG report in 2021 scorned the T for not ensuring BBB was doing this
contractual requirement, now they are, but I hope I’m wrong that I assume those
reports aren’t going right to the highly competent MCC Maintenance Control
Center which will deploy “the trades”  Via an organized service request system
that I’ve witnessed have facilities maintenance issues fixed within 24 hours
often. I suppose station cleaning is contracted out and not internal E&amp;M ,
but maybe MCC already sends service requests to contractors (?) because all
elevators are entirely handled by contractors.   Or they could have the
contracted crews who we see cleaning stations do an hourly check on this and
submit to their QR code system. Very easy. Or perhaps put the sign w the QR code
and elevator code on a pole a few feet away etc! I was in elevator 909 and I
didn’t get a chance to help solve this problem because I my willingness to help
has its limits.  I also wanted to mention that putting in complaints / comments
on the website is the originator source of many Engineering &amp; Maintenance
MCC service requests/ work orders! I will be pasting this text there next. There
are systems at the MBTA which operate effectively, much more so than I’d have
imagined before seeing this.   Also I think wetness sensors are possibly a
thing? Also there’s always inspectors and often CSR staff at substations , they
too could be asked to check the elevator maybe even just once a shift and ensure
that these reports are getting to the cleaning staff quickly. Cmon.

Title: Where is best to submit a complaint about no more JFK/UMass Commuter Rail weekend service?

Posted: 2025-07-12 04:16:42 UTC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm really upset about JFK/UMass service being fully cut from the weekend
Commuter Rail schedules for the Old Colony lines.   Taking the Red Line to
Braintree or South Station not only isn't reliable for catching your train on
time, but adds on almost an additional $5 to a round trip. Commuter Rail tickets
already aren't the cheapest and JFK/UMass serves many people in the area who
live in the Mary Ellen McCormack Project and in Columbia Point. This decision
physically and financially cuts off direct Commuter Rail access to low-income
communities. And in general, cuts off so many people from their closest Commuter
Rail access.   The train has to pass through JFK/UMass anyway and cutting it out
of the route doesn't even save significant time during weekend service. They
could have instead just made JFK/UMass a flag stop all weekend!  That being
said, would the best place to voice these concerns be by submitting a comment
for the MBTA Board meeting? Or is this something that the MBTA Rider Oversight
Committee would be a better candidate for? Or is submitting comments to both
entities the way to go? Or perhaps I should go about this a different way? I've
never dealt with something like this before so any guidance anyone can offer is
greatly appreciated.

Title: Extremely rude unprofessional bus driver

On the blue line which is just killing it today.  I was a half hour late for a
meeting in Revere.  Then on the way back without notice they decided to only go
to Airport and shuttle the rest of the way. After sitting at Orient Heights for
15 min I decided to grab the next west bound bus, try to get to Maverick and
take the ferry.  I get on the 120 and tell the driver casually I’m using this
bus in lieu of the shuttle since I just need to get to Maverick.  He says ok but
you still have to pay.  No problem.  I paid.  When I sat back down I said out
loud (not directed to him) out of sheer frustration:  I shouldn’t have to pay
for alternate transportation when the main form of transportation is down for
repairs. Then he started calling me entitled and was ranting about blue collar
something or other.  There was no need for him to engage beyond asking me to pay
but he kept going on.  I then asked him for his ID number and man did that
trigger him.  He gave it, then said something about yeah go ahead and tweet
about it whatever.  I was not saying anything, not engaging him.  Then he says
out of the blue, you know what just get off my bus.  He’s a public employee.  He
did not have to engage me at all, but he was obviously looking for a fight.  I
already called customer service and filed a complaint. You don’t get to act like
that when you’re a public employee.  Not a bus driver any more than a cop or
firefighter.  My points:  my statement about how it’s kinda crappy we have to
pay for an alternate form when the primary is down was out of frustration of the
whole trip.  It wasn’t aimed at him.  He didn’t have to say anything.   He could
have just kept his mouth shut but he wanted to be a tough guy.  We do still have
a constitution and a 1st amendment right.  I was neither rude nor threatening
towards him or anyone else.  He chose to engage and make an asshole out of
himself.  QUESTION:  Is the MBTA subject to FOIA?  I want to get the camera feed
for when this happened.  I know there are cameras on all the busses.  These are
your MBTA bus drivers folks.  (If anyone from the T sees this, please message
me.  I don’t want to have to go nuclear but I will if I have to.

Yes, of course this is a complaint because well it’s the MBTA. Before I vent,
great work with all you guys have been doing. But there’s this new messed up
system that I’ve noticed. Train pulls into their stop. They let people on. They
close the doors. They say we’re on standby. One minute, two minute, three
minute, four minute, five minutes pass door still closed and people who could’ve
ordered are now standing outside a closed Off train. They knock on doors. Some
conductors let them on. The second train usually waves him up to the first, and
if they’re lucky that conduct will open only the front door. Seriously, what the
fuck? You’re standing at a station and you’re hesitant to let people on? I timed
it today. Seven fucking minutes they kept the doors closed for seven minutes
while people ran to get on and they wouldn’t open the doors. What the fuck are
wrong with you people?  If you’re gonna stand by let passengers on? Also, why
the fuck do you have a problem with fresh air? Leave the doors open till you’re
ready to leave.

Title: 95 bus route to Arlington Center from Downtown Boston AKA Haymarket

I'd like everyone's take on this.  So I was messing around out of boredom one
night on chatGPT and asked the A.I about rerouting the 95 from its terminus at
Sullivan square in the Charlestown neighborhood to the Downtown sector of Boston
at Haymarket station. A.I says it wouldn't be in the best judgment to do so
because of traffic and other reasons such as customer complaints, duplicate
service with the orange line, maintenance of schedule reliability and get this,
alignment with the bus network redesign. LMAO. The last one is so laughable.
But what do you guys and gals think? Honestly for me, I'd be in favor of it if
it's to convene as a one seat ride from Boston to Arlington mass which is only
bordered by 1 bus, the 77.

As the title suggests, a vast majority of the complaints or rants shared in this
subreddit are things that could be easily solved by using the MBTA's "See
Something Say Something" webpage or the MBTA See Say app.  There is still a
shocking number of people who aren't aware that this tool exists, not to mention
how incredibly versatile it is at reporting all sorts of issues - from drunk
passengers, to people leaving garbage behind, to genuine safety threats, and
more.  People need to know that this is not only an option, it should be the
***VERY FIRST THING*** they do when they encounter a problem anywhere on MBTA
property.  Easiest way to do that would be to set up an AutoModerator in this
subreddit and have it link to
[https://www.mbta.com/security/see-something-say-something](https://www.mbta.com/security/see-something-say-something)
with a brief explanation of its functions whenever someone submits a post using
the Complaint/Rant flair.  It would save everyone a lot of time and effort and
spread awareness of this incredibly helpful app and its features.

all next month with this. I'm frustrated &amp; aggravated with this, its always
something they come up with and have to make our daily lives the most difficult
with these disruptions.  I'm about to just Ridehare my way around town to get

The Red line has gotten less awful in the past year but there are so many things
that are still just embarrassingly bad. The past several days there has always
been a signal delay around Harvard that slows down service to Alewife a lot. At
the Davis Square station, an escalator has been out of service for at least a
week, I’ve had to put in three ADA related maintenance complaints since Monday,
today one of the elevators was out of service for over an hour without even a
sign on it indicating that there was a problem, and to top it all off, the
customer service submission website is broken!

Title: 66 bus -- Roxbury crossing &lt;-&gt; Brigham Circle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I keep seeing periodic complaints about the 66. As a semi-regular rider on the
66 between Roxbury and Brookline, it seems to me that a \*major\* reason for the
issues is the small stretch between Roxbury Crossing and Brigham Circle on
Tremont St.  The first issue is crossing Columbus. Sometimes the bus takes 2
signals to cross Columbus to the OL station stop because the signal is
(relatively) short for the traffic, and, for whatever reason, the left turn into
Columbus from the OL station side of Tremont gets precedence. Also the
pedestrian crossing is 30 seconds. Transit priority + moving the pedestrian
crossing underground or overground should solve this issue -- and save 3-5
minutes. Given the recent tragic pedestirian accident in that intersection, the
latter should be a no-brainer for pedestrian safety as well.      The second
issue is Tremont St. Traffic there is single lane, but there's parking on both
sides. This stretch takes maybe 10 minutes on bad days for the half mile or so
between Brigham Circle and the station. The easy solution is to remove the
parking and convert to bus lane, or at the very least, ban parking during rush
hour, as on Washington St in Roslindale.  Is this something Boston can do
unilaterally? Is it worth raising with the Council?      (Another choke point
that I'm aware of is Coolidge Corner, but of course, that's in Brookline.)

Hello, everyone!  Over the last couple of days, we have seen an uptick in the
amount of posts that have focused on recent signal issues that has occurred at
Broadway and JFK/UMass.  While we appreciate all of the commentary that has
occurred regarding the MBTA’s need to repair the signal issue, many of these
posts would be better served by a comment thread, where questions can be asked
and answered easily, to avoid the subreddit being overburden by the same
question multiple times without any additional information/comments.   The main
issue with the signal is the fact they there are analog, meaning that they are
running on an outdated system and are easily impacted by the recent cold wave
that has happened in the Greater Boston area. This is probably why the signals
at Broadway and JFK/UMass are faulting. Sometimes, the internal working of the
signal may fail/not work, or it could be an issue with the system as a whole.
Trains use signals to know when a train is nearby or when they need to go at a
slower speed for safety reasons (i.e: slowzone, person on track, etc.), just
like you would while driving a car. If the signal malfunction, the train cannot
go at the full speed because of the possibility of an accident or derailment.
The MBTA is actively focusing on the entire signal system in 2025, with
shutdowns planned in areas where work is needed the most. The overhaul of the
signal should be done by early 2026, as the project is being accelerated by GM
Eng.   If you have any questions/information you would to ask, or add, please
put them down below!   Thank you for your support, as always!  - Holiday,

The r/mbta subreddit was also referenced in the article, linking several posts
by users who have supported GM ENG’s leadership and improvement of the subway
system since he began in April 2023.   **NOTABLE ITEMS**  * Under his
leadership, public perception of the transit agency has noticeably shifted as
the system has steadily improved, and Eng has become a rather unlikely local
celebrity in the process. Among his legions of admirers, he is better known as
the “King of Massachusetts” and “Train Daddy Eng.” “I’m just Phil,” said Eng
with a smile.  * Add it up (in reference to recent issues such as the October GL
derailment at Lechmere and the investigation ongoing at Cabot Yard) and Eng
isn’t without detractors, some of whom see his “cult” following as a shield from
their complaints about service, and others who question how effective his
leadership has been, particularly when some trains are still encountering slow
zones.  * There are regular posts on the T subreddit simply thanking Eng. If a
parade cannot be arranged, a statue erected in his honor will do just fine, some
have suggested. Maybe even letting him throw out the first pitch for the Red Sox
on Opening Day (should he be willing to break his allegiance to the New York
Mets). [Thanks for the shoutout, btw! :) ]  * “You know what? I love it,” Eng
said. “I hope they know that I appreciate them just as much. [in reference to
memes across social media praising him and the improvement of the MBTA]”  * Eng,
who committed to a five-year contract with a base salary of $470,000 a year,
said he has “no thoughts on leaving.” “I’m enjoying this role,” he said.
“They’ll let me know when it’s time to go.”  * Time will tell whether the scale
of work under Eng’s guidance will be “enough to actually fix the underlying cost
of the neglect,” said Dwaign Tyndal, executive director of Alternatives for
Community &amp; Environment, a transit-oriented development nonprofit based in
Roxbury. “Was this a real fix or was this a very expensive band aid?”

Last night, my partner and I took the commuter rail to attend a holiday party
out in the burbs (Framingham/Worcester line). Coming home, the 9:10 PM from
Worcester was cancelled. The notification asked customers to \*consider\* the
11:10 PM train due to "crew availability." We ended up taking an Uber home
because taking the next train would have meant TWO HOURS in the cold without
anywhere to stay warm. How can Keolis just..abandon people in the middle of
winter? If you don't have enough crew, maybe HIRE MORE? I just can't understand
how they think they can just abandon people with no way to get home. How can we
hold the company  accountable for this terrible service?

I'm waiting at Hamilton/Wenham for the Newburyport/Rockport line back to North
Station. the train was supposed to get here at 9:46 PM. according to the MBTA
website there was a delay at Ipswich for police presence. the train just totally
passed by us at about 10:22 PM without stopping... there were a few of us at the
platform and it just passed by! no shuttle buses announced or anything. the
customer service line is down so nobody to call. we're just stuck here and that
was the last train.   I'm splitting a Lyft home with a friendly stranger but
this is extremely disappointing... I hate to be a Karen but is there somewhere
to put in a complaint or something? if I was someone who didn't have the means
to afford a Lyft I'd just be stranded in Hamilton. it's not right that the train
just passed us to make up a couple minutes for people down the line, you know?
I'm an MBTA fan but this is pretty rough...  EDIT (October 13): Hi everyone,
it's Sunday and I wanted to apologize about this post and its insensitivity.
When I posted on Monday night there was no public information past the MBTA's
notice of "police presence," which I didn't know had the implication of an
accident. The exact confirmation about what happened wasn't made public until a
while after I made the post, so I had no way of knowing what had happened.
However, that's not an excuse. This post was hurtful to the family and friends
affected, so I'm sorry about causing that harm. I didn't mean to center my small
problems, but I understand how the post was insensitive after it was clear what
had happened. Also, I left the post up for much longer than I should have
without editing or context. In the future I'll be more understanding of things
like this and faster to respond to new information.  So, I apologize for the
hurt that I have caused. I wish that the friends, family, and community of the
victim find healing and peace.   Some resources that you may reach out to:  -

Title: MBTA News | Residents near Codman Yard say that MBTA did not alert them of construction near Huron Circle,  Boston councilman Fitzgerald asking MBTA to address issue. (via Dorchester Reporter)

 A public works project to improve and expand an MBTA facility next to Ashmont
station is receiving a fresh round of criticism from abutters, who claim the
construction is disrupting their lives and potentially damaging their
properties.  Their grievances were aired out at a meeting of the Ashmont-Adams
Neighborhood Association last Thursday at the Plasterer’s Union Hall on Minot
Street, where residents of Huron Circle, a circular side-street of about 25
homes off Gallivan Boulevard, were the most vocal participants.  They claim that
they were not properly engaged by MBTA planners and their contractors ahead of
the $116.6 million project, which has now been underway for about 18 months.
They say planners may have engaged with neighbors on other streets near the
facility, but did not do so with Circle residents.  The work, which includes the
noisy pounding of piles and other heavy work, is aimed at expanding the tracks
and other infrastructure inside Codman Yard, the storage and maintenance
facility at the Ashmont end of the Red Line branch.  “[The MBTA] did not include
our street on any construction map or do any outreach,” said one neighbor who
spoke at the meeting. “It was just waking up one morning to the sound of heavy
equipment and wondering what was going on. All of a sudden they are pounding,
digging up our street, and that’s not acceptable.”  “This has been going on
since October 2023 and I think I’m going to hire an attorney and try to stop
this, put a stop work order on Huron Circle,” said Alison McCormack, who also
lives there.  Roodly Dorleans, a project manager for the MBTA, was at the
meeting and countered the abutter’s claims, saying that pre-construction survey
letters were sent to six homes on Huron Circle. Only one responded, he said.
But other neighbors, saying they never received any communications about
construction, are worried that their home’s foundations might be impacted.
Huron Circle’s Lenny MacKoul, who has organized neighbors in an email chain,
said one major source of contention is the eastern side of the enclave, closest
to the MBTA tracks, where trees that provided a sight and sound buffer have been
removed. The prospect of those trees being replaced is not in question, but now
there’s a worry that there will be no greenery along the tracks, and instead
only stonework.  “We know it won’t look like it did, but it’s extremely
important we get that green space back and get some trees and get some
buffering,” said MacKoul.  His neighbor, McCormack, emphasized that point: “They
need to find it in the budget to address things on our street and what they are
doing to the trees here. We were never included in any of these plans.”  Other
complaints raised at the meeting included allegations of inattentiveness by the
State Police detail, lack of follow-through by the contractor, Barletta, not
baiting for rats, dust issues, and better project communication online.
Councillor John FitzGerald attended the meeting and said the MBTA needed to
address the issue immediately, particularly for folks worried about possible
damage to their homes.

Block by Block Transit Ambassador is a crap role. Basically nobody wants to work
this job. People frequently call out, and in the small amount of time I've been
here they've had two hiring events. Not to mention a referral program offering
you $200 for anyone you refer and that stays past a 90 day period. I would only
recommend this job to someone who needs work ASAP because they hire quick.  Why
is this? The job is dull most of the time, but a lot of people work dull jobs.
The #1 complaint is that we're not allowed to sit in the booth. Most of the time
nothing is happening, the most frequent occurence is someone has a question you
probably have in your mind on autopilot. I don't have a problem with the
repetitive questions, it's customer service. The real problem is you can easily
answer these from the booth window. They don't even want us leaning because I
guess it doesn't look professional. If we could sit in the booth I think the job
wouldn't be understaffed, and more people would rather come in for the easy
money instead of calling out.  Still I think it's a useful role to have. I do
enjoy when I actually get to help people, like when they leave things on the
train and with a quick call I get it back without them having to go to lost and
found the next day. Biggest thing is probably homeless watch, they love peeing

I want to be clear that I am happy that the B is getting some TLC. However,
there is a major problem: there is an almost mile long section of Commonwealth
between Washington Street and Harvard Ave where you cannot cross the street
because every last crosswalk is closed. This has been the case since at least
Wednesday, maybe earlier.   For people who live in the middle of that (like me)
it means basically walking a mile just to cross the road. I am able bodied and
can pull that off as long as I add 20 minutes to my commute time, but for people
who aren't, I can't even imagine how this is affecting them, especially in this
heat and humidity. Just getting to a shuttle bus across the street requires a
minimum of a half mile walk. I already reported this to the MBTA complaint line
earlier this week as an accessibility complaint and got an answer that made it
clear they did not understand the situation and fixed nothing. Is there anyone
you all recommend contacting?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW (summary of article by the Cambridge Day, pulling out
important information to present here):   * Somerville City Council President
Ben Ewen-Campen brought forth a resolution at the July 11 council meeting,
supported by local transit advocates TransitMatters, that asks the
administration of Gov. Maura Healey and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority to improve the reliability of service in the region and provide more
public data on the Union Square fork of the extension. The rest of the City
Council co-sponsored the resolution.  * TransitMatters analyzed departure data
on the green line extension, finding that trains leave from the Medford/Tufts
origin station on time just 51 percent of the time. By the time trains get to
East Somerville station, just four stops later, the number of on-time departures
drops to 35 percent. For trains headed north from East Somerville, only 19
percent leave on time and 23 percent are “bunched,” meaning the trains leave
very shortly after each other, leaving a long wait time in their wake.  *
Ewen-Campen and TransitMatters executive director Jarred Johnson also take issue
with the service’s frequent use of “express” trains, which bypass a number of
local stations. Johnson’s supplemental report argues that the green line is not
suited for express trains without a parallel track that can bypass local trains,
and that express trains can confuse riders through their lack of scheduling and
advertising, unnecessarily burdening non-English speakers and people with
disabilities.  * Express trains are only a Band-Aid solution, Johnson argues,
and there are better ways to address long times between trains, known as
headways. With the present system, Somerville riders pay the price for trains
that were bunched earlier on the D and E lines and never fixed.  * When
Cambridge Day spoke with Somerville business owners in the fall, many reported
no increase in customers from the new green line extension. One Union Square
worker cited the train’s unreliability as a reason for the stagnation.  * MBTA
officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Asked about the
complaints, an MBTA spokesperson submitted a statement: “The MBTA is committed
to improving reliability across the system, including reducing headways on the
green line.”

**SUBWAY IMPROVEMENTS**  As of June 2024, counting only *weekday service with no
service suspension in effect*:  * The Red Line operated about 300 trips per
weekday (versus 249 in June 2023). The time between trains improved on the
Ashmont and Braintree branches to about 14.5 minutes (versus 18.5 minutes in
June 2023) and to about seven minutes on the Red Line “trunk” between Alewife
and JFK/UMass (versus about nine minutes in June 2023).   * The Orange Line
operated 284 trips per weekday (versus 200 in June 2023). The time between
trains improved to about eight minutes (versus 11.6 minutes in June 2023).   *
The Blue Line operated 357 trips per weekday (versus 295 in June 2023). The time
between trains improved by over half a minute to about five minutes (versus
nearly six minutes in June 2023).  **BUS IMPROVEMENTS**  The MBTA has reduced
the number of “dropped” trips considerably from more than 8.3% in June 2023 to
about 1.8% in June 2024. Dropped trips are scheduled bus trips that did not
operate, which can occur when there are service disruptions, disabled buses, not
enough bus operators to run stated bus schedules, and other factors.  **THE RIDE
IMPROVEMENTS**  In June 2024, the RIDE’s on-time performance reached a record
high of 94%, exceeding the MBTA’s overall goal of 90% on-time performance and
well above its lowest average over the past 12 months of 85% in September 2023.
Additionally, the RIDE Access Center (TRAC), which is the RIDE’s dispatching and
scheduling center, substantially reduced its average call wait times from 13
minutes 22 seconds in April 2023 to 19 seconds in June 2024, also beating the
goal of a two-minute wait time. RIDE complaints declined to a record low in June
2024 of 1.87 per 1,000 trips.

I think it was my fault because I was standing in the shade but I just sprinted
after the bus only for it to slow down and then immediately hit the gas. I'm
pretty sure the bus drivers can't see in their rearview mirrors plus they can't
assume every rando running on the sidewalk is running after THEM but wow. shit
hurts when you've been waiting. won't happen again. next time I'll stand in the
sun.  also sorry to the little kids on the bikes who heard me cussing as I ran
lmao

posted, from simple questions to redesigned maps, from complaints about service
to policy discussions. The moderator team is glad to oversee such a positive and
constructive community of riders, advocates, and MBTA employees who wants to see
a better future for the public transit system we have here at home, even with
all of the current and future challenges the system faces and will face.   Once

Title: 94 and 96: why are they so late for the first stop?

this is about the 94 and the 96 both heading towards medford square. I've taken
the 94 from the davis and the 96 from harvard, the respective "first stops" of
each bus.  routinely the buses are 20+ minutes late. sometimes at mid-day
(around 3pm) and sometimes rush hour (6pm).   I totally get buses being late to
a certain extent. especially during rush hour. they have the come from
somewhere!    my question is: where are these two buses coming from that makes
them so late? I saw four 88's go by today at davis and often at harvard I'll see
two to three 77's pass. granted those are more frequently scheduled but jeez!
occasionally the buses don't show up at all. that's less frequent but still more
than a few times for each line since november. what gives?  I've submitted
complaints to the mbta but I don't think those go anywhere. does anyone have any
insight?

Title: Proposed Changes to the Sub - Rules and Rant Thread - We want your feedback!

Author: Chemical-Glove-1435 (ID: t2_ntr8ng08)
Posted: 2024-06-17 02:20:59 UTC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
starting off with the proposed rules.  # Purpose:  One of the main goals of our
expanded mod team was to come up with some rules for the sub, to ensure
continued civility and to encourage thoughtful discussion. Even though the sub
is currently doing (relatively) well right now without rules, this is Reddit
after all, and things can quickly deteriorate. As such, it is fit to institute a
set of rules now, while we can thoughtfully discuss such matters, rather than
rushing to implement rules if/when things go sour and emotions are high. Also,
us mods are enforcing some general concepts (be civil, no spam), but we want to
make sure that all users know the exact expectations through rules (and are
treated as equally as possible). Rules will also help to make enforcement more
even by giving us mods a concrete baseline on whether or not to take action,
instead of just feelings.  # The Proposed Rules:  **Rule 1: Be Civil.**  No
offensive, hateful, or otherwise unpleasant behavior toward individuals,
organizations, or groups of people.  **Explanation:**  This is the most
important rule on this list. One of the core things that makes  such a good
place is how (relative to some other subs) civil it is. The goal of this rule is
to make it even more clear that we will not tolerate any nastiness.
**Enforcement**:  Enforcement will depend on how bad the infraction is. If it is
very minor, then we will give a warning. If it is moderate-severe, then the
content will be removed. The most severe and repeated infractions could result
in a user ban, the length of which is at the moderator's discretion.  **Rule
2:**  All Content Must be MBTA or Boston area transit related. Any content about
other transit agencies/areas must relate to the MBTA/Boston area transit in some
way.  **Explanation:**  This is a sub about Boston-area public transportation,
specifically the MBTA. However, it can be important to use other agencies and
their policies for discussion purposes. This rule will even out current
enforcement while continuing to allow for things related to other agencies to
contribute to conversation.  **Enforcement:**  Either a warning or removal,
depending on content visibility, relevancy (if it's in a gray area, then we will
write a reminder in the comments), and frequency of offenses from that user.
**Rule 3.**  No Spam/Low Effort Posts. Posts that have no effort put into them
or don’t add to the conversation are subject to this rule.  **Explanation:**
This community strives to be one with high quality content and good
conversations. Low quality posts or posts that don't contribute have no need to
be here.  **Enforcement:**  Post Removal. If a user continually spams, then a
temporary or permanent ban will be administered.  **Rule 4**.  Flag NSFW posts.
Any posts that contain NSFW material must be marked as such.  **Explanation:**
This is not an NSFW community. Many of us don't want to see that kind of
content, so PLEASE flag it as such.  **Enforcement:**  Post removal, ban on user
if there are repeated infractions.  **Rule 5.**  No editorializing/opinionizing
News Articles in your post title. Don't make it seem like a news source is
saying something it isn't. You are fully allowed to include your opinions on the
news article or its contents within the text of your post (not the title) as
long as it's made clear that it's your opinion.  **Explanation:**  To quote  ,
this "goes against the spirit of Reddit"  **Enforcement:**  If the case is
deemed minor, then a written warning will be given out. If the case is deemed
major, then the post will be removed. If there are repeated infractions, then a
user ban is on the table.  # Please Give Feedback  We want your feedback.
Implementing these rules would result in some changes to the sub, and we do not
want to do this without community input. We're looking for feedback on whether
or not you like these rules, any additions/removals of rules you'd like to see,
any changes in proposed enforcement, etc. Even if you have no complaints/changes
and like the rules, please comment.  # Rant Thread  **Purpose:**  We all know
that the MBTA can suck a lot, and there's LOTS of stuff to rant about. However,
it's really hard to facilitate this with just regular posts. Too many ranty
posts can clutter up the feed, and many will often get downvoted to smithereens.
This in turn causes people to feel that they really don't have a place to rant
about the T, and such a place IS very much needed.  By providing a dedicated
thread for ranting, we can both provide a better space for more ranting and make
more space for less ranty posts.  **How it would work**  The rant thread would
always be a pinned post, except for unusual circumstances where something
extremely important comes up. This post would be refreshed weekly, posting every
Sunday at 12AM. Within this thread, we would encourage people to support each
other while also sometimes giving some information about rant topics. Again,
this thread is a place for people to be able to rant without worrying about
being downvoted or ignored.  **Would I be required to post any ranting here?**
No. It would be completely optional as to whether or not to put your ranting in
this thread.  # Please Give Feedback  We want to know what you think about this
rant thread, anything you would change, and if you don't like the idea. Even if
you have no complaints/changes for the rant thread, please comment.  Thank you, 
u/Chemical-Glove-1435 on behalf of the  mod team.

Title: How do Bostonians put up with North Station operations?

This station is operated like crap beyond structural issues.   First, the
wayfinding is total garbage, and where it exists it’s often just wrong. How can
station operators be so lazy? It’s unfathomable! For example, the sign that
points to men’s and women’s restrooms ahead and to the right is just wrong and
always has been wrong. The men’s room is behind this sign to the right. How
could no one possibly care enough to fix this?  Second, boarding is wildly
inaccessible. Why are we boarding 750’ down the platform? My grandma can’t walk
that far and many I know wouldn’t. Why on earth wouldn’t they board cars closer
to the station and adjust stopping points at stations accordingly? This is an
ADA complaint in the making.  Third, why are we always packed in like sardines
when we’re paying for the fuel and maintenance to run massive trains? What a
total waste of resources. Does no one here care, at all?!   And fourth is
unrelated to North Station but while I’m shitting on MBTA, what the hell. Why
are Green Line trains that terminate at Gov’t Center coming up as departures on
the departure board?!?

Hello, fellow MBTA riders and advocates!  For those who may now know me, I am
Holiday (or Alexander, whichever one you prefer)! I am one of the moderators for
the MBTA subreddit, alongside Digital, Russian, College and Chemical.  As the
MBTA subreddit continues to grow (as we just hit 13k members, thank you so much
for all of your posts and comments!), the moderator team has been talking about
how to best make the subreddit the place for all news MBTA-related.  As a result
of this, I would like to open this conversation up to the entire MBTA community.
Because of this, there are some preliminary ideas we have been floating.
POSSIBLE NEW RULE REGARDING COMPLAINTS  1.) Please try avoid using this
subreddit as a place to complain about the MBTA. We all know service sucks and
shuttles are not great. We are thinking about opening a complaint thread where
you can submit issues you may have and where to best send it to, but the general
rule is **if you have a complaint, it needs to have a point to it (for example,
asking how the T can improve bus headways).   POSSIBLE NEW SEGMENTS  1.) “Remake
the T Sign” Competition  2.) Shuttles reviews (talking about different shuttles
segments and how the T can improve it for future shutdowns) 3.) Post regarding
how to contact legislators, transit advocacy groups, etc.  We want to hear from
you. What other ideas do you have for new rules or posts we should start?  As
always, stay safe and proactive.   Signed, Holiday

Tonight I was on the red line shuttle leaving JFK/UMass and headed back up to
Park Street when a man suddenly burst out, in a very Mass accent, "are we going
to Quincy or Boston?" The driver ignored him but a man quietly confirmed Boston.
This poor man was a little bit astounded. Apparently someone had told him the
bus was going to Quincy. So he asked again, this time with more despair in his
voice. I turned around and told him yes, we're going to Boston, this bus ends at
Park Street.  Boy you'd think I'd have told him he has some kind of severe
illness for his reaction. He was like legit devastated and said a loud a few
times that he needed to get off as fast as possible. I told him our next stop
was Andrew and he proceeded to tell a sad story about having had surgery and
there's "no pretty pictures" (which I assume is something of a reference towards
the light at the end of the tunnel?) I didn't know what to say so I said
nothing.  I wished him luck getting to Quincy as he got off at Andrew.  This
isn't my first interaction with some of the more colorful people who use the T.
This city fascinates me in many ways.

So today, I was on the 5:42 to Wickford Junction and had a "lovely" exchange
with a conductor.  So i usually get off at Sharon and first of all, I never
heard an announcement over the speakers as to where we were supposed to go to
get off the train. So imagine myself and several other passengers very confused
as to which way we were supposed to go. And to make matters worse, one of the
doors between cars was not open so we had to open it manually.  I saw said
conductor and as I was exiting, I said very flatly  (admittedly out of
frustration) “an announcement would’ve been nice.” His response? He yelled at
me. His words were “An announcement was made multiple times! Maybe if you had
your headphones off, you would have heard it! Try listening next time!” He was
yelling directly at me as I was heading down the exit ramp which meant other
patrons could hear him. Now to be clear, I do travel with noise canceling
headphones but I can confirm, I did not wear them once that entire trip.  A
complaint has been filed, doubt it'll do much progress. But I felt I had to say
something.  Anyway, just needed to vent and thought this would be a lovely place
to do it.

Hey, everyone! Hope y’all are having a good Friday so far!  Just hopping in here
to let everyone know about the new mods that have joined the r/MBTA subreddit
and what I have planned next for my (very frequent) posting.  As of today, when
this post is made, the current mod lists is as followed:  * u/CollegeBoardPolice
* u/Chemical-Glove-1435 * u/justarussian22 * u/Massive_Holiday4672 * u/BosUrbEx
* u/digitalsciguy  Please contact the mod team if there is a concern about a
particular post or if anyone breaks Reddit’s TOS or our rules. Many of us are on
for at least a couple of hours a week, so we can see when a report is made and
then make the appropriate action.  For complaints about the T, PLEASE USE THE
CUSTOMER FEEDBACK FORM via the T’s website before posting it here. While we
appreciate all of your posts, we also want people to proactively report things
that may be a major issue to the appropriate people (and doing so here means the
report wouldn’t be seen in the right place since none of us are directly
affiliated with the T).  Expect Chemical to continue posting slow zones updates
and I will continue to post new updates on diversions and trying to engage y’all
with posts that hopes to drive conversations on things that are not well-talked
about on the T (with a post about the Commuter Rail coming this week).  Thank
you for the subreddit community for all that you do, and until next time, stay
proactive and safe!  Duartes (Massive_Holiday4672)

I've prompted ModSupportBot for mod suggestions for a first round of very active
folks to directly recruit. I don't have the time to develop a formal application
process right now, but perhaps when we get a few more active mods, we can
discuss that internally how that might help us maintain a healthy moderator
body. I plan to reach out to the top 5 or so folks by the end of this week.
Additionally:  * I'm reviewing [Moderator Code of

Edit 2: welp, they brought it back! Not sure if complaints worked, they changed
their minds or I just got the wrong information.   Edit: thank you for your
replies. I’ll admit I was pretty furious that morning and took the low road
ranting online, but I’ll leave this up because I believe the express bus should
still run this coming week. I’ll look into the alternatives people have
suggested, though for many people having help along their existing route is
easier than changing their commute entirely. I’m lucky that my job is forgiving
during these shutdowns but that’s not the case for many. I’ll also specify that
my criticism is solely for the scheduling, and that the shuttles themselves have
been clean, comfortable and timely and drivers are very friendly and
professional.   I’m completely out of patience. We’ve been gritting our teeth
and dealing with these closures for months which I understand are necessary. The
saving grace of the most recent green line shutdown has been an express bus to
Copley that allows rush hour commuters to get to work on time. I was just told
this morning they are not running express shuttles anymore. These were the best
idea they had and they killed it after a week. I’m in disbelief, I feel so petty
but it should not take TWO HOURS TO TRAVEL FIFTEEN MILES IN ANY CITY UNLESS
YOURE ON FOOT. U

Since today has seen quite a couple of shuttle bus services, I think it is time
to talk about it and see what we can do to make the T know about what it can do
improve future shuttle service.  Couple of reminders:  1.) The actual shuttle
buses are done by coach companies, NOT the T.  2.) While complaints are
important, I want to try to have a productive conversation about it because that
will be better long-term. 3.) Traffic will impact how the bus will go and being
near the actual GL stations and being accessible for the disabled and elderly
are also important. 4.) This GL shutdown hopefully deals with the slow zones
near Fenway/Longwood, Kenmore/Hynes, Cleveland Circle, and Blandford-BU Central.

There were a lot of complaints here (including myself) about the Alewife - Davis
stretch being bogged down by traffic - including from me, since that stretch
took me an hour yesterday.  This morning I happened to board a shuttle they
warned me was "Express" before I boarded.  Took me straight from Alewife to
Harvard in ~22 minutes.  I have no idea what the full deal is with this (maybe
someone else knows and can help explain when/how to snag these?) but wow, what a
breath of fresh air in the middle of shuttle hell.  Update (also posted as a
comment): I asked someone what the deal was, and they said that in the mornings
when it's crowded they often run express buses - to get one, you just need to
ask the person monitoring the boarding if they have any available.  Apparently
this happens pretty often in the mornings, and if they have an express bus
available they're happy to direct you to one.  It doesn't happen in the evenings
when it's less crowded, but in the mornings they almost always have them.  Game
changer!

Seen a lot of complaints on the Red Line and want to issue this reminder:  *
Many of the T’s infrastructure are in serious need of repair. From the signals
to trains that are either about 30 years old or 50+ year olds, these items are
bound to break.   * Lack of adequate and smart funding from the state and
federal government and lack of a strong maintance staff (which is why some jobs
are contracted out) only compounds your issues.  * The Red Line has tons of slow
zones because running trains at full speed will cause problems such as
derailments or excessive sparks that may cause fires. These have not been keep
up to date. Many of the current operators are just as annoyed about the slow
zones are you are. Taking your anger out on them doesn’t do anything.  *Eng
INHERITED these issues. Don’t blame him for the problems; blame the governors,
state legislators, and past leadership and staff that failed to make sure the
system worked in the first place.  In other words, this is why supporting the T
and asking the government to support it more is needed.

Over the past few months, I started taking the commuter rail to Ruggles for my
daily commute 2-3 times a week. The MBTA publishes track assignments on its
schedule and has digital signage with tracks and times in the station and on the
platforms, in addition to (spotty but present) automated announcements with this
information.   The problem is... these track assignments are consistently wrong!
Particularly in the afternoon/evening. Combined with digital signage on the
trains themselves that I estimate is not working maybe 40% of the time and the
fact that the trains are always slightly late and rarely arrive at the posted
time, this can cause confusion for people unfamiliar to the station.  The most
egregious problem is that inbound trains after the AM rush switch from Tracks
1/3 (then main island platform) to Track 2 (the side platform). But on the
schedule/signage/announcements for at least the inbound Needham and Forge Park
lines, it still has them on Track 3 all day. And it is not possible to sprint
from Track 3 to Track 2 once you see (without any warning) that the train is
coming on a different track. I have personally missed my train because of this,
and today was trying to help a couple other people who were totally confused by
the multiple incorrect track assignments that occur every single day (they also
missed their train).   Because Ruggles is 90% regular commuters, the
predictability of the complete wrongness of the track assignments has resulted
in most people know which "wrong" track to go to. But for the people unfamiliar
with the station or schedule, they're simply out of luck. I assume the track
assignments were correct at one time, but then when Track 2 was reopened the
schedule was never adjusted. This is not a hard fix!  I have submitted several
complaints to the MBTA which then go to Keolis about this issue. I get a generic
"sorry for the inconvenience" form letter and I don't have much hope that anyone
at the MBTA or Keolis cares. My first complaint was in August and nothing has
changed. I don't miss my train anymore but I submit the complaints anyways
because I am trying to draw any attention whatsoever to the problem. There is a
vague statement in the email about a future attempt to improve signage but I'm
not sure how that helps commuters now.   I find this issue and response
emblematic of the casual incompetence of the agency, the contempt it has towards
its passengers, and the hostility it exhibits towards "outsiders" who don't
"just know" how to navigate the system (a great characteristic for a system
trying to grow its ridership!).   If anyone else notices this or other similar
issues around the system, I would encourage you to submit complaints as well.
There is a link on the MBTA website and it takes about 5 minutes to fill out.
I'm not sure if anyone at the MBTA will ever notice or care, but at least
if/when there is ever any audit of this situation they can't claim they never
knew or were told about the situation. Deep down I just wish the MBTA wasn't the
abject embarrassment it is for our city and state.

Hi everyone! I take the 39 bus nearly everyday to get to work, going outbound
towards forest hills. I use several applications to help track when the bus is
scheduled to arrive to help with my schedule and minimize my commute time.
Usually, the bus is on time, and rarely has it been late. However, as of
recently, I have been waiting for the bus for nearly 30-40 minutes every single
day. This is absolutely absurd!   When using the MBTA tracker, the time went
from arriving at 2:18pm, to 2:25pm, to 2:35pm. I sat at the bus stop with
several other patrons since 2pm, waiting for the bus with no arrival. The bus
finally arrived at 2:40pm, which gives me barely enough time to get to work at
3pm. This can’t be a fault of my own — I left with an hour before work and could
still be late somehow.   I am curious if there is a specific place I could speak
to someone about this, and just lodge a complaint from a concerned commuter.
This bus issue has only just happened, and so I am not sure what the cause of it
may be and regardless it is not okay!   Thanks so much! I appreciate all your
help!

standing in the asile BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SEATS. I physically can't make it to
the bathroom car and need to use it immediately.   You need to add more train
cars on this route. It's unacceptable. I will not pay and I will not let my

I was on the Green line C branch this morning, outbound, between Hawes and Kent.
I was sitting in the seat right by the front door and suddenly heard the
driver/operator talking on the phone. It clearly wasn’t work related because he
ended the call by saying “I’m at work, I gotta go, talk to you later.” This was
a single car train, so the driver was fully responsible for speed/braking, and
we were moving while he was on the phone.  I submitted a complaint online with
the car number, date/time, branch/direction and everything. It didn’t strike me
as an emergency situation since he did hang up quickly, but now I’m wondering if
this is a situation for the see something/say something app? I’m fully aware of
the history of cell phones and safety violations on the T, so I was pretty
stunned that the driver was so casual about it.

Worked the Patriots Game vs New Orleans Saints game today at Foxborough, MA.
Around 6:30PM, while my coworker was going to carpool a group of home to Boston,
we found 2 abandoned passengers (father and son who:  1. lived in Back Bay and
could not get the commuter rail train back home because only 1 train left
Foxborough 30 mins after the game  2.  Could not find an Uber/Lyft to get them a
ride back home; therefore, who wanted to journey to the Foxborough area to pick
up passengers after the Patriots Game  3. There is no designated Uber/Lyft ride
share area to pick up passengers at the gates.  Could you please provide a
better solution to this problems that many other game guests face.  Thank you,

Does anyone know is if it’s normal for a train car to aggressively sway side to
side? I’ve been riding the T for years now but I haven’t ever felt it move like
this. I was riding the red line this weekend and it accelerated pretty quickly
after Harvard and the car was swaying pretty aggressively side to side that if I
was standing I probably would’ve been thrown to one of the sides. I put in a
complaint to the T because this was kind of concerning thinking this could lead
to a derailed train. Has anybody experienced this or knows of this is normal for
a train car to do?

Have to share that I had no complaint about the T experience I had today. I
boarded the OL at Bunker Hill to head down to Copley. Got dropped off at the
station and made it onto the train right as the doors closed. Having a moment of
stupidity attributed to my lack of OL  experience, I hopped off at north station
to change to GLX to go the rest of the way to Copley. Took new train for both
lines and Green line felt really smooth (questions about the really loud heat
seeker alarm on the ride). Went to my tailor once I made it to the mall. The
nice surprise was to come out the building to see the OL back bay station, scan
right through and hopped on back to Charlestown. Not a realistic commute since
it was 10:30 on a Saturday, but if the train gets any faster that would be even
better!

I tried to bring my bike on the inbound commuter rail train today at Quincy
center and was told I could not, due to there being no room.  The conductor then
told me that starting in the next month or two, bikes would be officially
prohibited from this commuter rail line altogether.  I haven't found anything
posted about this yet - can anyone verify? I'm planning to toss my complaints

&amp;#x200B;  [Frustrated MBTA commuter Andrew Cohen has devised a new way to
make sure complaints about the MBTA reach the desks of decision makers: Sending
them postcards. ANDREW

[Globe.com](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/26/metro/you-need-fix-this-want-send-officials-message-about-state-mbta-try-one-these-free-postcards/):
“Something physical like a postcard is real. It’s in your hands. It’s hard to
ignore,” said Andrew Cohen, 30, who printed out the postcards last week and
distributed them at T stops Thursday. “Anybody can complain on Twitter, but with
a physical card that was given out in Boston, that a real person put pen to
paper to and dropped it in a mailbox — that means they feel strongly about
\[what’s going on\].”  Each postcard [includes the mailing
address](https://i.imgur.com/eENS1RT.jpg) for the MBTA and Governor Maura
Healey’s office, as well as a link to a site that helps residents [find the
contact information for their state
representative](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator).  The cards
are available in red, blue, green, and orange, to align with the MBTA train line
colors passengers ride most often, and include a message that says, “Dear MBTA,
You need to fix this. Build a better T.”  Those who send them in are encouraged
to write their own personalized messages about how the T has let them down,
before dropping them in a mailbox.  Cohen, for example, wrote about how his
commute from Randolph to Cambridge on the Red Line has now ballooned to an
hour-and-a-half each way.  “I just want it to underscore that people need this
service. It can’t be put off, or ignored, or postponed any longer,” Cohen said.
“We’re at this crisis point where it’s almost non-functional, so we want to keep
the fire under the people in charge to keep moving forward and take this
seriously.”  On Thursday, Cohen and Sebastian Luu, a 21-year-old Suffolk
University student, stood outside Downtown Crossing and Park Street stations and
handed out about 40 postcards passersby in under two hours.  The postcards
themselves were free. Cohen said he will accept donations from those willing and
able to chip in — a handful of people did after learning about the project [on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/13sa31h/i_thought_it_would_be_hilarious_and_clever/)
— but he’s more focused on making sure they’re getting to the right people.
Given how well the first round of handing out postcards went, they plan to order
a new batch and return to T stops at some point in the next week or two.

The MBTA needs help. That's obvious. But how do WE help solve this problem? We
can just sit here, blaming politicians for all of our problems, and ranting our
souls out in angry posts. But, this will not help. We MUST demand change.
[https://www.mbta.com/customer-support](https://www.mbta.com/customer-support)
This link is a good way to tell the MBTA what should be prioritized/improved.
Any ideas that you might have for improving service can be submitted here, along
with complaints/questions.   I personally submitted a request for more frequent
service on the Fairmount Line, and invite all of you to do the same, even for
different projects. The more people that request for relatively cheap increases
in service, the more likely they are to happen. But, while telling the MBTA what
you want to happen, be realistic. They have a finite amount of resources. We
must go further, to demand more resources be given to the MBTA, and for the MBTA
to have more oversight.   I also invite every single one of you to write to the
politicians who represent you, asking them to do everything they can to fix the
MBTA. Tell them to get more and more sustainable funding for the MBTA for years
to come. Tell them to prioritize safety in the near-term, maintenance always,
and middle-to-long term expansion/improvement projects. Make sure to tell them
how important the MBTA is to the well-being of the state, and its people.   If
you think that there is no hope for change, that people at the higher levels do
not care, then make them care. If ALL members of this community, all 5,641, tell
them what we want to happen, then they might have no choice but to listen. We
all must unite, actively advocating for better service. THIS is how we make
things better. Please, I beg you, do something. If you have already written to
your local politician, or the MBTA, please do it again.   So, what will YOU do?
Will you sit on reddit, writing angry comments? Or, will you advocate for
change, for a better MBTA.

This is the complaint I filed with the T a few minutes ago.  I know damm well
they won't give a sh\*t, (and to be fair I'll update if they do):  &amp;#x200B;
I arrived at Downtown crossing on the Orange Line, intending to transfer to the
Red Line.  There was no assistance of any kind with the ongoing construction
project that shut the Red Line.  There was no signage, no instructions given on
the Orange Line as the train pulled in, and there were no Customer Service
Representatives on either platform.  I didn't even know that the Red Line
platform was closed until I went downstairs and walked down to the Alewife
platform, only to find it fenced off.  There were no signs or guidance there
either.  By this time there were 50 other people with me trying to find a way to
secure any public transit.  We all walked to Park Street, reasoning that this
was the place most likely to have either shuttle buses or customer service
representatives.  When we arrived there was a long line of customers with who
had also made this decision.  Finally we were sent downstairs to the Red Line
platform.  &amp;#x200B;  The behavior of the T was unconscionable; but it's
clear that Block by Block was worse.  All the passengers last night suffered
significant delays not because of slow zones, but because the MBTA couldn't be
bothered to put out a single sign or give simple directions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):  There have been so many problems with the
MBTA’s new Red and Orange Line cars — derailments, a battery explosion, loose
brake bolts, malfunctioning doors, disconnected wiring, years-long delays — that
weary riders have likely forgotten one of the long-awaited cars’ most criticized
features: The incessant, loud beeping sound they make when the doors are open.
Now — four years after the first new train began carrying passengers — the T is
retrofitting the fleet with a different, less frequent sound.  The change is the
result of testing last year with riders who are blind or visually impaired. The
sound is meant to guide riders to the doors and indicate that the doors are
still open.  The retrofitting began in January, said Laura Brelsford, the T’s
assistant general manager for systemwide accessibility. So far, 64 of the 82 new
Orange Line cars and all 12 of the new Red Line cars have the new sound, said T
spokesperson Joe Pesaturo.  The new sound aims to address concerns from the
general riding public — that the beeps are disruptive and too loud — without
sacrificing the benefits for riders who are blind or visually impaired,
Brelsford said.  “We had reason to believe that this was a new feature that was
going to take folks a while to get used to,” she said. “We really began looking
into it as complaints persisted.”  The beeping feature is a much-welcomed assist
for riders who are blind and visually impaired, said Reggie Ramos, director of
Inclusive Public Transit at the [Institute for Human Centered
Design](https://www.humancentereddesign.org/), the Boston firm contracted by the
T to test the feature.  Eleven riders reviewed their experiences using the new
Orange Line trains from October to December last year, Ramos said, and chose a
new chime from five options provided by the T. The group reported that the
feature was “extremely helpful,” Ramos said, especially when boarding.

Title: Family of Robinson Lalin, man dragged to death by Red Line train, sues MBTA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):  The family of Robinson Lalin, the man who
was dragged to death by a Red Line train last April after his arm got stuck in
the car door, is suing the MBTA.  A complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court on
Wednesday by the Lalin family alleges his death was “caused by the carelessness
and negligence of the defendant MBTA,” including the train operator’s failure to
check that the doors were clear of passengers before moving forward, and the T’s
failure to “properly inspect, maintain, repair, and monitor the subway cars and
station,” according to the complaint.  One of Lalin’s two children, Christopher
Lalin, and his nephew, Kelvin Lalin, are named as plaintiffs. The family is
seeking an undisclosed amount of money and cites economic damages as a result of
Lalin’s death, including medical and funeral expenses, lost wages, and lost
earning capacity.  A spokesperson for the MBTA did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.  A Red Line car trapped Lalin’s arm between its doors after
he exited the train at Broadway Station around 12:30 a.m. on April 10 and
dragged him around 105 feet down the platform, according to a [preliminary
report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/RRD22LR008.aspx) from the
National Transportation Safety Board. His body was found near the tracks 75 feet
inside the tunnel, his hand severed, according to a police report obtained by
the Globe. Lalin was 39 years old when he was killed.  In a statement, Kelvin
Lalin urged T riders to use caution, recalling his uncle’s tragic death.  “Our
safety isn’t certain, and we should all be worried every day we ride the T
because it has proven that it does not have our back as riders and it is not to
be depended on,” he said. “The T issues are very serious and we must stand up
and come together to address it for our friends, loved ones, and every resident
in our city.”  Lalin’s death was one in a long series of grave safety incidents
on the MBTA that spurred the Federal Transit Administration to take an increased
oversight role of the agency and conduct a nearly unprecedented federal safety
inspection last year. That inspection found that the T’s focus on long-term
projects had come at the expense of day-to-day operations and safety.  Federal
investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board , who continue to
look into Lalin’s death, [have so far
said](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/RRD22LR008.aspx) that the car’s
door mechanism designed to prevent the train from moving while the doors are
open failed. A final NTSB report about the incident could come in the summer, a
board spokesperson said.

Here in lies, my evening commute catastrophe. Made the pathetic attempt to file
a complaint with the MBTA to which our AI overlords to be laughed and spit in my
face. At least Reddit can be cathartic outlet...  North Quincy red line
Braintree route on 2/22/23 at 345PM.  I buy a monthly pass, and when attempting
to swipe my card, the screen said, "See attendant", well lucky for me, no one is
there in the cubical. I swipe my card again, and now the screen says, "Not
enough value." Mind boggling as I have the monthly pass. Used it this AM no
problem in Braintree and confirmed by swiping card on the console and clear as
day says "monthly pass - expires 2/28/2023".   What am I to do, as the last cart
comes through for the next 28 minutes into the north quincy station? I have to
catch a commuter to middleborough for 425PM in Braintree. Do I hop the gate? Of
course not, that would be silly, my mum raised me better than that. What would
you do in my situation?   I've since taken a Lyft from the North Quincy station
to the Braintree station, because, like most people, I'd like to get home at a
decent hour after having taken the 550AM train from Middleborough.   The amount
of stress this situation has put on me is evident from my smart watch telling me
I need to breathe. AI on my wrist works better than the MBTA, but I digress.
So I'm left in this stressful conundrum. Missed my train, my card doesn't work,
no attendant is available, and I just want to go home after a long day at work.
Lyft to the rescue.  Again, another piece of AI that works better than the MBTA.
Once I'm at the braintree station, after a lovely ride from my driver, Jessica,
I swipe my card again to try it out. Would you believe me when I said it, I have
the same issue. Shocker!   Lucky for me, there is an attendant here in
Braintree. He swipes my card again, "see attendant." He swipes my card on the
console and confirms i have the monthly pass that expires 2/28/2023. He swipes
his card at the gate, waits, then swipes my card at the gate...alas! My misery
washes away at the sweet, sweet sound of the gate swinging open. If I think
back, I even had to wipe a single tear from my eye. THE RELIEF!!   Now here I
am, sitting on commuter rail en route home and without the stress and fear that
I miss my train again tomorrow AM. Aside from the stress and anxiety, I now am
out an additional 18.99$. If the MBTA would care to cover that and make me
whole, we can all put this behind us.   I look forward to hearing back from
someone where we can have a good laugh at the whole situation.   Cheers!  PS:
Why would I think the website would work? Oh silly me, what was I thinking. I

Title: How to report nasty / mean MBTA bus driver?

Hi,  I take the bus daily on the MBTA and for some reason for the past two or
three times a specific bus driver has had a nasty attitude towards me. The first
time this driver was mad that I already overpaid. Then this past Tuesday the
driver went into my personal business and asked why I didn't put money on my
Charlie card because the machine wasn't working to take money. I already have
mental illness and these experiences have made me have anxiety. I also need to
know if the number in the front is the bus number? And how to report this
person? I've already reported this driver online at the MBTA complaint site.
Should I also call in to leave a message?  Thanks.

I filed this as a complaint on the T's website yesterday morning.   I am
presently riding one of your newer buses, and they look impressive and modern,
it continues to have this two fatal flaws. 1-Both the acceleration and and
breaks are are so swiftly applied, that these buses both speed up from the
stops, and then the when breaks are used, they are applied so sharply that if
you are standing, you hold on to dear life to a poll as to not fall forward, or
if you are sitting down, you end up in the persons lap beside you instead. To
say the very least, this does make make for a pleasant and comfortable ride!
This wouldn't be so bad if all the seats were facing forward, but to save space,
you have single seats situated sideways.   This must change! Too many of people
in the Greater Boston area are dependent on the T, and have no other choice than
to endure it!  This is simply unacceptable. I am however sure that the people at
Mass Dot could spend, say $50,000 on maintenance to tweak the breaks. so that
the ride is much more enduring instead!  P.S. when I wrote this, I was
completely unaware of The Boston Globe's news article on this!

Title: Expansion Ideas or Lack of Planning?

I'm working in a Masters degree in government/international relations.  While I
enjoy it, the MBTA really annoys me and their planning gets me riled up, so I'm
contemplating switching my program.  I've vented some of these ideas to friends,
co-workers, and bartenders who have seemed to be receptive, or just won't call
me crazy to my face.    Full Disclaimer:  I grew upon the North Shore and still
live there, but I currently work in central Mass., i.e. I drive to work every
day but attend school and spend much of my time in Boston.  I also lived abroad
for several years and have used the transit systems in Montreal, Toronto,
Denver, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and probably a
few others, which I draw some of my ideas from.  First, there needs to be a ring
line that circumvents the metro Boston area.  Boston is small in terms of area,
but its suburbs are sprawling. Therefore everything within I95 should be
considered an extension of Boston.  A line that travels from the North shore, to
the metro west, to the south shore would relieve car stress on I95 in the tech
corridor and more T rider traffic away from downtown.  Ideally from Salem,
following I95 through Woburn, Burlington, Waltham, and onwards to Brockton or
Plymouth.  Second, we therefore extend the blue line through Lynn and onwards to
Salem.  Show of hands, who really goes to greyhound tracks these days?  I
thought so.  Lynn is the 10th most populous city in MA, Salem is smaller but is
growing and has a great restaurant scene.   The commuter rail should cease to
exist within I95.  Thats right, extend all subway lines outward, so all commuter
rail lines terminate at Oak Grove, Anderson/Woburn, Alewife, then go express
into Boston.  That ensures commuter rail riders do not have to travel strictly
into North or South Stations before changing lines.  Riders in Chelsea or
Mattapan don't have to rely on the slow commuter rail for their transit.
Eliminate railway crossings as much as possible.  This would take a lot of money
invested in infrastructure, but I've seen it in action in Narita and Tokyo.  If
railway lines are uninterrupted, i.e. they don't cross roads, they can travel at
a higher rate of speed and cut down on commuter travel time.    Eliminate the
12:45 end of service.  This is more of a budgeting issue, but who hasn't been
reliant on the T and left a bar early or overpaid a taxi?   The service could be
cut back to 3 am and run every half hour.     Anyways, those are my rants, I'd
appreciate comments, ideas, more rants, complaints, or insightful opinions.

Hi all. I just moved to Boston and have never lived anywhere near a city before.
Was riding the red line the other day and a man entered the train car. He kind
of stood in the middle of the car looking at the seated people awkwardly, and I
noticed that if I shifted seats I could make room for him to sit down, so I did.
As I did so, I made eye contact with him, smiled, and gestured toward the space
that opened up. He kind of like laughed at me and then sat down. He kept staring
at me for a bit, and began ranting incoherently. As time went on, he began
pointing at me repeatedly and saying "this guy is a fucking motherfuck" or
something that didn't make sense to me. I was trying not to make eye contact,
and when he got louder I stood up and moved slightly. He kept pointing at me and
started shouting "GET OUT!" and looking around saying "this guy" while pointing
at me. I just tried to avoid eye contact and eventually exited at my stop
without any further event. I know to more seasoned city dwellers this might be a
common occurrence and nothing to worry about, but I was just hoping to hear if
there is anything I can do to avoid drawing attention to myself like that, and
generally what tips y'all have to stay safe on the T since it had me kinda
spooked.

Catenary wires already exist along the Northeast Corridor, which the Providence
line aligns with, so investment and construction of new infrastructure isn't
really needed here – it will prove feasibility and viability of commuter rail
electrification on other lines, and boost efforts to electrify the other
commuter rail lines.  Benefits I can already think of:  * Enhanced service
quality * Reduced emissions in enclosed stations such as Back Bay, South Station
and Forest Hills * Cleaner trains and stations * Faster acceleration, meaning
shorter journey times and possibility of higher frequency trains serving all
stations along the route.  Another rant – Can we PLEASE make the entire length
of ALL commuter rail platforms high level for easy boarding/de-boarding? This
will help with accessibility of the commuter rail for disabled passengers (not
to mention ADA compliance).

Just witnessed horrible display of islamophobia. A man was speaking in Arabic
language on the phone (respectfully, with headphones in) on the blue line from
Govt Center toward Wonderland around 3:40pm today and a white dude probably late
30s in a beanie, a backpack and one of those stupid samsung flip phones began
shouting at the man for talking in his native language, mocking him and how he
spoke, telling him to go fuck himself, to go build a bomb, antagonizing him to
punch him, etc. The man on the phone hit the emergency button, we stopped, and
the driver told him he could file a police report and we sit there or they move
into separate cars and we move on. The man on the phone stayed in our car while
the other guy moved. The asshole later came up to the window once he got off at
Maverick and began taunting the man on the phone through the glass.   I would
have filmed him but was too close to the asshole and didn't want to get punched.
Just wanted to rant, wish things could have gone better. The poor man on the
phone said he has been living here 15 years and this has never happened to him.

Why the hell do people cram themselves into Shuttle Buses like sardines to get

will almost always have plenty of empty seats?  I see it every day with the
ongoing Blue Line shutdown, and same thing last weekend with Orange Line shuttle
buses. 98% of the time, there are another 2-3 buses waiting for the passengers.
Had one of the T workers today tell me that there some more standing room places
on the bus, and my response was "No thanks, I am waiting for the next nuts.

The evolution of this pass over the years has been fascinating to say the least.
The top one is my favorite -- it's a paper thin/metal-ish plastic card with a
watermark that says 'MBTA VALID PASS' when shined under a light. Not ripped that
easily, if at all, and can withstand wear and tear. Oh, and $235 a month back in
2009!  The middle one is just a CharlieCard repurposed to act as a pass.  And
the bottom one for this month is a crappy paper pass...

My commute this morning from Maverick to Bowdoin today had long dwell times at
every station along the way, with the operator announcing it was due to signal
issues in the "problem area" between State and Government Center. It's a bit
baffling to me that after a 9 day shutdown, the Blue Line re-opens worse than it
was before the maintenance.   Does anyone have any kind of insider knowledge or
any insight as to what kind of signal issues are causing the daily delays/wait
times in the morning with the Blue Line currently? I'm grateful for Eng's push
to have work done to improve stations/service, but I just wish the T would
release detailed information or updates regarding these types of issues. I can't
be the only rider who is feeling the frustration of having worse service after
bearing a whole line shutdown. 3 days after the line being back up and it's
still having consistent, daily signal issues and delays that I can only assume
that most riders feel should have been ironed out during the 9 day shutdown.
Rant over. I still love the Blue Line but the lack of communication on a *why*
is frustrating.

This afternoon was boarding Orient Heights Express at Government Center. 4 buses
all lined up for Express service, and the first 2, including mine were boarding
at the same time because my bus driver had told the dispatcher that the  2nd bus
needed to go at same time because that driver had to follow us. My rant is with
both buses boarding and departing at same time, why on Gods green earth, did
20-25 more passengers crowd on and stand when they could have taken the 2nd bus,
or even the next 2?  You seriously want to stand all the way, to get home 5-10
min earlier?  and the Express got snagged in serious traffic and that little

Please people. Im begging you. When you board the bus, have your cash/card in
hand. Don’t hold the line up fumbling around in your bag for your wallet. When
you’ve got a tight connection or somewhere to be it’s really annoying when the
bus has to stop and wait for you to do this—especially when multiple people are
fishing around for their wallet  While im ranting, let’s start loading Charlie
cards using the machines at stations whenever possible. PLEASE. Obviously, if
you’re boarding on the street I get paying cash. No problems there. But if
you’re leaving from Forest Hill’s or back bay or whatever, it’s really annoying
when people don’t refill when waiting. My bus home is routinely 3-5 min late
leaving Forest Hill’s solely because a bunch of the passengers, who just spent
half an hour standing around, refill their cards using the machine when they
board, which takes forever. The station machines 20 feet away accept cash, they
weren’t running to the bus or anything, and the bus was on time from the depot.
It’s straight up just delayed because everyone seemingly loves to use the bus
machines. It legitimately delays busses, I know there’s a plethora of other
reasons why the bus is delayed—but there’s no reason in adding one more

The shuttles being slow and having to deal with traffic is one thing given the
shutdown.   I could deal with the shuttle if the rest of the stations were
running as normal, but NO!   The trains that used to run 5 minutes apart during
my usual commute have been hitting 10-15 minute headways on top of stopping for
5 minutes at every station with no additional notice from the MBTA.   Commuting
has been a nightmare because on top of the 45 minute shuttle, it takes me an
extra 20 minutes to get to north station in the first place!   This service is
just unacceptable. I've tried 2 days in a row to get the commuter rail service
from north station as a replacement for the shuttle. Yesterday I left on time to
get to north station 15 minutes early. Today I left on time to get to north
station 30 minutes early.   Well guess what, even planning to be there 30
minutes early, these trains are so delayed that I will still be taking the
shuttle anyway!   At this rate I am leaving home 45 minutes earlier than usual
and still getting to work 20 minutes late.  Gotta love standing by at every
single station just to get stuck in traffic on the shuttle. The train I am on
right now has not moved in 8 minutes and is holding for who knows how long.
They wonder why people think this service isn't worth paying for.

repair at Wood Island. No estimated wait time. No other explanation of how/why

years when I worked in corporate before finally breaking the chains and going

Second time for me this morning, getting a 4 car Red line train.   I thought
they were supposed to do that 'off hours' only, but apparently rush hour is also
fair game.  No matter how much they announce beforehand, half the people don't
move before the train arrives, so the  last car gets sardine-packed.   Then the
dwell time increases as the doors are held for people to move to the 3rd or 2nd
car to try to find space.    To top it off, the trains always stop at the
forward end of the station no matter what, rather than stopping 'where the
entrance is'.  So, on my northbound trip this morning, at both Park and Charles
they stop at the far end of the platform, but the main platform entrance is at
the rear of the platform.  Now everyone has to run forward and back to piling
into the last car.  The added dwell at each stop added 5-10 minutes to the whole
trip.  Where are those new GD RL trains?  /rant\_off   :-)

I'm just curious as usually, with the orange line for instance, if there's
shuttle buses to a certain station then boarding at that station is usually free
while the stations after that cost money to board. Also,making a ride to south
station free with one mode (purple line), but a ride to JFK/UMASS on a shuttle
bus to then ride to south station on the red line cost you 2.40 seems
inconsistent.  I don't know, I just think it should be consistent throughout.
I'm not on a huge rant or anything, just something I noticed about the way
different lines operate when it comes to shuttle service.

They posted the new schedule out on each CR line, including the new Fall
River/New Bedford service and bringing back the Worcester super express.   Go
check it out and start your trip planning! Yeah... It's the same shitty
schedules as last time that I ranted on last week (for most lines).

I take the orange line daily. They've done a great job with headways at rush
hour. This post is anger about me running late in the context of a system that
just can't get out of its way.   I just waited at oak grove on a train for 12
min after missing a train. There's absolutely no published delays, but if 6 min
headways are the norm and a train is waiting 12 instead of 6 there should be a
delay.   After my train it looks like the headways are fixed, with 6 min
intervals. If there was a minor issue earlier or a dropped trip and you want to
hold my train to accomplish that, hold mine for 8, then the next for 6-8, etc.
Until you get back on. Now there's a random 6 min extra gap in the system
instead of 2-3.   All that being said, I know us orange line riders have way
more to be thankful for and seem to be experiencing less pain than the red line
these days.   There's just minor things the T could do that would make things
"feel" better, even tho it's just a few minutes here and there.   Ok rant over.
Eng has done fantastic work, funding is limited, Rome wasn't built in a day.
TLDR: don't bother reading I'm just letting off steam over a few min but it's
still annoying 😅

Just here to rant about something that happened this evening after work. I
walked down the stairs at Central and there were five guys waiting by the fare
gate. I didn’t realise what they were there for, but as soon as I tapped my card
and walked through, one of them stuck out his hand and held the gate open for
his friends and said, “See, I told you it’d be free..”  I’ve had people get in
behind me before (especially at Central) and never really cared about it, but
this incident annoyed me a lot. Am I wrong to be so bothered by it? What would
y’all do in such a situation?

Currently stuck (for the fourth time) between Lechmere and East Somerville after
leaving my office near Arlington at 6:30pm.  Stopped for 5+ minutes at the North
Station tunnel ramp to west end, at west end, Lechmere, and now stuck between
Lechmere and east Somerville. Still here at 7:43pm.  I was originally going to
write my rant about taking too many trains out of service at Gov/North when
there are full platforms, but that might be a rant for another day.  Edit: Still
stuck between Lech &amp; ES @ 7:55.  Some additional edits since I looked at
text history. I left my office at 6:23, probably within 5 minutes was on a train
headed home. Was taken out of service at ~6:58 at North. The next train which
was supposed to be Union was also taken out of service. Got on an MT train
around 7:05 and on the same train getting off only 3 stops later at 8:08pm.
Luckily I’m getting picked up at East. But those of you still on this train, I
wish you luck!

I usually cut the T a lot of slack overall, they’re doing much better (and doing
the best they can given the financial/political situation over the years), but
why is it so difficult sometimes to get a Green Line train from Park Street to
North Station?!   During rush hour today (5ish) I had just missed a train to
Union Square, then the next 3 trains terminated at Government Center. Finally
got on another GLX-bound train like 15 mins later only to have it immediately
taken out of service at… you guessed it… Government Center.   I lucked out
because my commuter rail train was delayed, would have missed it otherwise. But
this is a long way of asking… we have 6 new GL stations, 4 lines and Amtrak
running out of North Station… why do so many trains still terminate at
Government Center?

Mini rant…  1. There’s been delays ALL week. Today it’s a disabled train, a few
days ago the doors didn’t work.  2. The old school LED sign that lists the next
departures is apparently unfuckingreliable. A delayed Braintree train arrived at
south station at 5:00, the sign said “Ashmont BRD” and “Braintree 10 minutes”.
Then AS the train takes off the conductor announces “Braintree. Braintree
train.” Now the sign says “Ashmont 5 minutes” “Braintree 10 minutes”  Jfc  Is
the T too underfunded to have automated announcements and the conductors too
lazy to consistently announce the destination at each stop?   /end rant

There isn’t anything that can be done about this now, but I just wanted to share
this in here to serve as a reminder to always look out for what’s going on
around you and to do what is best for your safety. Yesterday this lady that was
sitting in the corner of the car came up and sat next to me and asked me to use
my phone. I said no, and then she proceeded to go on this whole rant basically
cursing me out. I missed a lot of what she said because I tried not to pay
attention and I got up to move towards the doors to switch cars while she was
yelling. I remember her telling me that she hopes nobody helps me when I need it
and that she hopes I d!e, which is just insane. Thankfully I was able to switch
cars at the next stop without her following me, but the fact that nobody else
around me did anything was pretty crazy. I don’t live in the state so I don’t
use the T every day, only every once in a while if I’m in the city so I don’t
have the see say app. This was definitely a wake up call for me to get the app
because this whole situation left me kinda shell shocked afterwards. Sorry this
was long, I just wanted to share this to serve as a reminder to everyone that
they should always be aware of their surroundings, because I’m sure I’m not the

This Red Line shutdown is pure misery. Before, the green line hooked me to the

Reverting to using the 1 Bus and 77 Bus is fucking awful. I'm 30 minutes late

Firstly, I want to truly thank every single person who has interacted,
commented, and posted in r/mbta. Our growth over the last couple of months has
been amazing to see and I cannot wait to see how far this subreddit will go
towards the goal of improving public transportation in the Greater Boston area.
I also want to give a big thanks to the moderation team, especially Russian,
Chemical, and Digital, for everything they have done to help make this community
better for everyone. When I began my moderation position in May, I was nervous
about being a new Reddit moderator, but it is great to have amazing people
alongside me to support me and give me advice that I use today.   As we continue
to grow rapidly, I think this is a great time to ask the subreddit what they
want to see change. Is there a specific rule or policy we should implement? Is
there a contest you want to hold? Do you want to see more advocacy work in the
community? Do you want a space to rant when the MBTA gets delayed once again,
like always? Do you want a specific place for MBTA news, slowzone updates, and
new maps/PSAs?   Please let us know below in the comments or send us a Modmail;
we try to check it daily!   Speaking of the Modmail, if you have any concerns
about a user, having any issues in the subreddit, or want to ask a general

The MBTA buses typically peeve me, but my anger at the 78 is through the roof. I
live in Allston &amp; am interning in Lexington, so I take the 66 to Harvard to
get the 78. This takes about an hour if everything runs smoothly but I give
myself an extra 30 minutes because it never does. This morning I planned on
taking the 10:18 &amp; got there with 20 minutes to spare. But the bus never
came despite the transit app saying it did. I gave it some time bc I understand
delays, but I ended up having to spend 30 bucks on an Uber to get to work on
time. Similarly, after work, I have to get to Porter Square to attend classes so
I am on a time crunch &amp; have about an hour and a half to get there.
Theoretically I can get there in 40 minutes of the bus comes when it is supposed
to but it never does. I understand that there are delays with traffic &amp; with
summer construction, but today the bus came early. It does a loop &amp; I
watched it pass me the other direction &amp; then by the time I got to the stop,
it had come and gone 10 minutes early. I am actually so pissed off that I
consistently have to wait 30-40 minutes despite planning out my commute based on
the schedule (bc god forbid anyone sticks to a schedule). There isn’t even a
bench at the bus stop.  That is just my rant. I hate the 78, but need to
consistently rely on it for the next three months still.

It’s rush hour. We packed in like sardines at Lechmere. We rode for some time.
And juuust before arriving at East Somerville, the conductor told us that this
particular train is running express to Medford/Tufts and will not be stopping in
between.   So over half of the train piled out onto the East Somerville
platform, and we all piled back onto the next train. Thankfully, that one wasn’t
running express.   This is the third time I’ve encountered this situation, and
I’m annoyed. During the first time, I couldn’t make out what the conductor was
saying, so I had to get out at Medford/Tufts and wait over 10min to reverse
course.  In NYC, it’s clear up front whether you’re about to board an express or
local train. (And, unlike Bostonians, New Yorkers know to not wear their fxn
backpacks on a crowded train… but that’s another rant for another time.) Why
can’t we have something similar in Boston?   Even a warning while boarding the
T, as opposed to during the ride (or whenever it’s too late to leave the train),
would go a long way. But if there’s some express train resource that I haven’t
discovered yet, please illuminate me!

WARNING - MAJOR RANT!!!      Well, to start off, I felt excited to have caught
one of the brand new Red Line cars, one of them being one of the newest to be on
the road (Car 1915).      However, that enthusiasm quickly turned into anger
because there were 20+ young Red Sox fans partying and drinking, basically
trashing the train car.      When they left at Park, that group left and
basically left a major mess, especially with at least a dozen empty nip bottles
as well as a few empty cans and their area being wet on the ground and leaving
quite a bit of trash behind….     Needless to say, an elderly man really went on
a major rant himself, yelling how our taxpayer dollars went to buy these subway
cars and how these (fill in the blanks) are trashing it and how even pigs are
cleaner than these good-for-nothings and other related rants about their
behavior - and I basically agreed with him on everything about it!

I had the unfortunate fate of going to work on friday, the same morning as the
celtics victory parade. On the way to work in the morning, there was a buzz
about town but normal amounts of people on a train. Lots of people were drinking
nips and cans of beer at 9am, which was a funny scene but no one was bothering
anyone.  When I got out of work and headed through the gauntlet downtown, I saw
an ugly sight; thousands upon thousands of drunken suburban types who don’t have
the slightest clue about how to ride the green line. People posting up at the
doors from Hynes to North Station, not moving into the train, causing people to
push past them then drunkenly muttering shit under their booze-laden breathe.
These people were saying the whole time “man, that T is so fucking slow. This
shit sucks.” I remembered thinking GTF out of the way! The only reason that we
can’t get the train out of the station is idiots like you slowing down the
process! One dude in his 30s (either a rough 20 or a really good late 40s) was
running his mouth with a north shore accent the whole way from kenmore to north
station said “I never take the train. Last time I took the green line was the
patriots parade.”  We should have informative posters and early-childhood
educators waiting at north station for future celtics parades helping passengers
from the rotting mill towns realize that you don’t stand in the doorways and
other general T etiquette. What poster ideas would you recommend? Please give
themes discussed and extra points for how you would say it to an uncurious
townie frightened of the big mean city.  Posters include: You wouldn’t block
stand in the doorway at the packy*, why would you stand in the doorway of a
train?  You wouldn’t try to fit 40 people in your uncles rotted-out 2006 Chevy
suburban while refusing to let the doors shut after leaving your grandmas
cookout, why would you do it with a train?  You wouldn’t pee in a crowded
barroom, why would you do it on a train?  End rant.  *This means package store
in the parlance of New Englanders. We will not entertain any discussions that
are reaching out for reasons to deliberately attribute that locals are more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will try not too make this too rant-y because I am genuinely curious if theres a
reason behind the below issues.   1) When dispatching, SL1/2/3 will frequently
all leave within 1-2 minutes of one another, destroying the frequency for WTC,
SLW, and especially Courthouse (of which it seems like 70% of the bus gets off
at every time). Why not simply space the departures out to provide substantially
more reliable service on a section that is in its own tunnels?  2) When buses
are going outbound from SS, frequently the SL1 will board at the end of the
platform, then pull up and board again. All while an SL2 / 3 sits behind it
waiting for it to pull away for that one to board. Why not just have them pull
all the way up and then board? Or, just dispatch them in a slightly different
order so as to not have this problem.  3) Similar issue occurs for inbound
buses. Many times I will be on the bus in the tunnel still because there are
empty buses still at the platform so theres 1-2 mins of dwell time until they
move ahead into the turnaround loop / outbound platforms (I know they’re often
empty and not passengers exiting because I observe this while waiting for an
outbound bus)

I made a post about this on the r/Boston subreddit, but I think making the same
post here will be better.  When I look at the T as a new resident of the city, I
realize that there is a big issue when it comes to advocacy for the T. A lot of
people complain about the T, which should be allowed and even encouraged,
especially at the state the T is in. However, I think that many Bostonians are
not complaining with nuance. What I mean by this is that I see too many people
complaining how the T is very slow or falling apart. I don’t see a lot of
conversation about how the state allowed the T to be in the situation it is in
by doing a forward funding system in 2000, basically causing the T to fund
itself through sales taxes that did not rise with inflation or increasing prices
for resources and upkeeping. Or how the federal government is not doing enough
to either take control of the T or force the state to do more to keep the system
running.   While we have organization such as TransitMatters and SteetsBlog Mass
are trying to build the connection between citizens and the state, it seems like
legislators are not doing enough to proactively respond to this at all levels,
aside from the task force, which will not respond until December. That does not
help the fact that the T is facing a $600 million dollar deficit starting in
July for the next fiscal year.   Bostonians needs to engage with their
politicians more instead of expecting the state to do something about the T. The
state legislators clearly do not care about funding the biggest transit system
in Massachusetts, or how not doing so and letting the T fail will cause millions
of people to potentially lose their jobs or access to very needed resources,
cause a major increase in traffic, and may even cause many to leave Boston
entirely. If they don’t seem to care, we should make sure that they know that we
know that they are not doing enough every day until they do something.   We need
to turn up at meetings with the T, turn up to City Council meetings to advocate
for more bus lanes, turn up to the State House to protest against the state’s
horrible policies for public transportation, and support the workers who are
working long hours to keep Boston running.  I want to hear your opinions about
this. Thank you for reading this long rant.  EDIT: I want to add here that while
I don’t think people should make the T their entire life, it is just as
important to turn up every once in a while for meetings with both your city and
the T.

Kind of pissed rn because this made me really late.   The bus was nowhere near

obviously waiting at the stop. I even tried running up to the bus when it went
past me hoping it would stop. Like, I made it very obvious I was there.   And
the next bus wouldn’t be coming for another 20 minutes which is why I’m upset
because I was going to be late to my shift.   I’m more ranting because nothing

Title says it all. As a student, the situation is just depressing. I live in
Somerville and work in Kendall. I moved to my current apartment a year ago
largely thanks to its proximity to the red line. However, recently, between
walking to the station, waiting up to \~12 minutes for a train - even at peak
hours - then absolutely *crawling* down to Kendall and walking to work, a
15-minute car ride takes up to about 50 minutes to complete by T (and that's if
the trains are even operational, and not delayed down at Central for 25
minutes).     So, usually I bike, and it takes me under 20 minutes to get to
work. No problem (except getting hit by a car once, but no major injuries, so I
continue to bike because - hey - this is Boston, and that's just how it is).
Well, last week, during that huge road resurfacing period down near Inman, the
city of Cambridge left a **huge** stretch of road completely unpaved for days
with no obvious indicator of when it would end (literally a giant stretch from
Inman almost all the way to Kendall). Since I stupidly assumed that the
construction wouldn't last so many days, I kept biking that route, and lo and
behold my brand new front tire popped mid-week. (Brand new because my original
bike was freaking stolen while locked up outside work two months back).     Now,
to get to my usual bike shop, I usually - you guessed it - *bike*. You know
what's not at all conveniently accessible by the T, since you have to take the
green line (which doesn't allow bikes) to get there? The bike shop!!      So
now, sometime this week, I have to scrounge up the money to rent a Zipcar and
get my tire replaced. Then go through the whole ordeal of actually getting the
tire replaced. And in the meantime, I'll have to lose an hour of my life every
single day to the extra time it takes to get to and from work on the T.     As a
student in the Boston area, this is just depressing. It feels like at every
single turn, everyone in charge of any kind of transit is actively trying to
screw you over. Terrible T? Fine, I'll bike. Road work needs to be done? Fine,
I'll bike whatever unpaved route they allow. Tire popped? Great, now I have to
figure out how to pay for that *plus* at least a week on the T, which doesn't
deserve nearly the $22 it takes to get a week pass.      Anyway, this is just an
unproductive, anonymous rant online, but living here feels impossible at best
and downright adversarial at worst. Looking at my popped bike tire, I just don't
know what to do with myself other than cross my fingers and hope that I can move
far far away after I finish school here.      **tl;dr** I do everything I can to
avoid the red line and get on with my life, since transit is so tough here, and
even that isn't an option when the city doesn't care about bikers.

I’m on a train from the South Shore today. We’re stuck at the wye that connects
the Greenbush line to the Old Colony main. We get stuck there for 10 minutes.
Why? Because a Middleborough train from South Station is behind schedule and we
have to wait to be clear to proceed through the Quincy single track.  That
limited infrastructure cascades through the schedule and may not be rectified
until well after rush hour. We were only a few minutes late to South Station,
fortunately, but another late meet could foul things up for the rest of the day.
Add in the unpredictability of extending Middleborough trains to New Bedford and
Fall River, causing more possible delay points, and you have a mess.  I get that
we can’t double track the entirety of the line, especially in the Quincy
stretch, without major work. But the status quo is nuts. It also prevents the
commuter rail from being a reliever to the Red Line when the RL is (when, not
if) fucked.  Sorry for the rant, it just amazes me that we’re so shortsighted
with infrastructure projects. Some of this could’ve been addressed 30 years ago
when they were rebuilding the Old Colony. But nope.

&lt;rant on&gt;  Back in the days when passenger rail was run by the railroad
companies themselves, they had a neat trick.  To get out of being forced to run
commuter service, they would run trains late and on poor schedules until they
drove ridership away.  Then they would go to the state and say "See, no one
rides these trains, let us cancel them."  So the #43 used to have 3-4 buses
during rush hour, and 2 buses during off hours.    Now it's one bus.  Meaning,
if it's running on time, a 45-minute wait between buses.    Makes me think they
are working their darndest to kill the bus line.

with their hand when coughing but c'mon, that's almost just as gross because you
are going to touch all sorts of things with that hand that you just coughed on,
spreading germs.   Yes, I'm a bit of a germophobe but if we're trying to prevent

a fare increase that is said to be used for improving the rail system across the

the 5 working days this week no one has come around to check tickets. What
gives!?   I get on at the beginning of the Middleborough/Lakeville line and get

Please feel free to help me understand some of the things I’m kinda frustrated
with- cause I’m pretty new to regularly using the MBTA (specifically commuter
rail and redline)   I’m an incoming grad student at UMass Boston  and I’m
commuting from home and will rely on the commuter rail- however they changed up
the schedule this summer and JFK/UMass now has pretty limited services/no
services during my class times (4-9:45 pm).   It’s a pretty easy fix of taking
the redline to/from Quincy Center- but I’m still kinda frustrated that this
change happened right before the school year started and looks like it will
remain through the fall.   I’m assuming the change was made due to the
cost/usage ratio of the station itself- it’s just kind of annoying when I
already have a longer commute.

trains recently. Is it just me?   I was so glad when the track work was
completed this past year and felt like things were going in the right direction.
Taking the T has really become a test in patience and accepting that I’ll be
late to work on a regular basis. I understand it’s a huge project due to years
of neglect, but damn this is annoying! My commute is already 40-50 minutes on a
good day, so having these delays all the time is very frustrating.  Folks who
work for the MBTA- would love to hear from you especially. Lots of respect for

Hey r/mbta,  We've seen a recent resurgence of posts with photos or videos of
people's faces, trying to call them out for [**anti-social
behavior**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour) on the T. We
get the frustration, but **this kind of content directly breaks Rule 1 against
personal attacks and crosses into doxxing.**  # Moving Forward  **From now on,
any posts or comments featuring identifiable images of people for shaming will
be removed. Keep doing it, and you could face a temporary or permanent ban.**  *
**It's a Personal Attack:** Our Rule 1 is clear: be civil and respectful to
others. Posting someone's face to shame them publicly is a direct personal
attack. It unfairly targets individuals for humiliation and can lead to
real-world harassment. * **It's Doxxing:** Even if you don't use a name, putting
someone's identifiable face online with the intent to shame invites others to
become vigilantes. This can lead to misidentification, serious harassment, and
even danger. Reddit's sitewide rules, and ours, forbid this. * **It Derails
Discussion:** These posts quickly turn into arguments, speculation, and
eventually racist vitriol that becomes unmanageable. * **It Makes Our Community
Unsafe:** Our main goal is a safe and respectful space. "Name and shame" content
breeds hostility and puts people at risk.  # What to Do Instead  Feeling
frustrated by anti-social behavior on the T? Here's how to make a real
difference:  * **Report it:** If you see a safety issue or a crime, [report it
directly to the MBTA Transit Police or MBTA
staff](https://www.mbta.com/security/see-something-say-something). * **Advocate
for effective solutions:** Beyond traditional policing, many transit agencies
are exploring and implementing a range of strategies to improve safety and
reduce anti-social behavior (like smoking, littering, or disruptive conduct).
These include:    * **Unarmed Transit Ambassadors/Social Workers:** Deploying
unarmed personnel trained in de-escalation and social services can provide a
visible, friendly presence, assist riders, and connect vulnerable individuals to
resources. (See examples from [LA Metro and other
agencies](https://www.rtachicago.org/blog/2025/03/27/what-chicago-can-learn-from-transit-ambassador-programs-around-the-country)).
* **Targeted Interventions:** Addressing root causes of specific behaviors
through programs like the T's new [low-income fare
initiatives](https://www.mbta.com/fares/reduced/income-eligible) ([enabled by
new
funding](https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-celebrates-mbtas-new-income-eligible-reduced-fare-program))
can improve access and reduce instances of fare evasion that might otherwise
contribute to disorder. (See studies on the [impact of low-income
fares](https://ombonu.github.io/discounted_fares_study.pdf) on mobility and
well-being.) * **Discuss the** ***behavior*****, not the person:** Talk about
the problem itself, not the individuals involved.  For significant funding or
policy changes, consider contacting your state legislators directly, as they
play a key role in the MBTA's budget. For feedback on existing operations or
specific services, the [MBTA's feedback
form](https://www.mbta.com/customer-support) is often the best route.  We know
you care deeply about the MBTA, just like us. Let's work together to keep r/mbta
a productive and respectful place.  Thanks,  The r/mbta Moderation Team

Spoke with some very frustrated people who’d been wrongly advised to go to “21
Arlington Ave, Charleston” for lost item, wasted time wandering around several
buildings unsuccessfully, before finding the correct building only to see
signage indicating the Lost &amp; Found phone # (617.222.2229 for that location,
[website lists all](https://www.mbta.com/customer-support/lost-and-found)) -
lost item seekers must call first to confirm that their item has reached the
admin at that Charlestown Bus Garage (aka Bennet St Bus Barn) and she makes
arrangements with customers. I wouldn’t know whether it works differently at
other Lost &amp; Found pickup locations….  Apparently this is happening
frequently over the last few weeks. My haunch is that someone is trying to be
helpful by sharing info (the street address) of where an item lost is supposed
to end up - but they’re just causing everyone more of a headache, because even
if they indicate which building and which doors to go in and how many feet
across the hallway to walk, that admin may not be working at that moment or item
may be not there yet, elsewhere….  The [info on the website for lost and found
is correct](https://www.mbta.com/customer-support/lost-and-found)as far as I
understand. figured I’d share this background on why it only indicates the phone
numbers and no locations (presumably).

We were standing on the platform at Gilman, headed towards Medford/Tufts. About
6PM. Fare validated. Front car. Train arrives, we step aside to let ~20 people
off. As soon as the final passenger exits, the doors immediately close. I look
for a button or something on the door, no luck. Bang on it a bit, but maybe not
hard enough? The train pulled away. Everyone on the platform was denied an
opportunity to board, maybe 5-10 people total!  We've never seen something like
that before. So, what happened? Operator error, zoning out? Or maybe they were
trying to prevent the scary guy on the platform from boarding? (White guy with a
gray hoodie, screaming profanities about nothing, threatening to fight random
signs (?) the entire time we were there.)  Either way, we had to abandon our
travel by train after that. The math worked out that a fast walk / light jog to
our destination was the only way to make it on time. I was frustrated by this.
At least the weather was nice!

As someone who gets on the B line at government center to get to work every day,
the turnarounds at Park Street are the worst - trains that actually have 7-8
minute headways end up having 15 minute headways because only half the trains
end up coming to Gov Center.  I get that it’s easier to turn around at Park, but
half the trains just aren’t servicing a stop on their line and then there’s no
communication about it! Frustrating but not the worst problem with the MBTA so
I’ll take it.   Also not sure if there’s any data to back this up but I’d be
interested to see what percentage of trains get turned around at Park.

So I don’t take the commuter on the regular and only take it for occasional day
trips, therefore my knowledge of the schedules aren’t that great. One thing I
don’t get is why there’s a two hour gap between each departure time from either
station?  I notice the trains get in at a specific time and then it’s a whole
40-50 before it departs again. This seems quite frustrating if something comes
up and you’re late to your train. I feel like in other places, you could just
take the next train out that’s like maybe an hour later, but why are we waiting
two hours before we get to take the next one out?   I presume it’s not like this
during the week but this seems like a really poor schedule for the weekends.

I was on the red line this afternoon and at Quincy center station a young black
man (who I later found out is 16) boarded the train. He was smoking a blunt, as
a weed smoker I fully understand the frustration with public consumption and
agree in situations like this it is out of hand but this is not how to handle
it. We pull thru Wollaston, no issue, we get to North Quincy. Two men board the
train separately at this stop. One of the men asks the young man to put his
blunt back. He responds in a disrespectful manner and continues smoking. The man
goes to the end of the car and hits the emergency intercom (at this point I also
put in a See,Say report). He has a brief conversation with the conductor and
then we resume moving. Before we can even get to the neponset bridge a second
man walks up to the teen, yells at him to stop smoking and before the teen can
react the man picks him up and SLAMS him into the wall twice, he then throws him
to the ground and stays on top of him until we get to JFK. The man who used the
intercom then goes over to back up the man holding the teen down. Myself and
several other passengers immediately yelled at the man to stop what he was
doing. During this the teen disclosed he was 16 and the man STILL did not get
off of him. When we pulled into the station a single transit cop was left to
handle two men and a teen. All three were detained and our train moved on into
the city.   If you’re the Kid, DO NOT DO SHIT LIKE THAT. Not only is it
disrespectful but people are extremely reactive these days. I hope this serves
as a lesson for you but I’m very glad you made it out of this okay.   For the
adult: you’re a scum bag, full stop. You don’t put hands on people, especially
when they’re a MINOR. Two wrongs don’t make a right.   TL:DR: teen assaulted by
fully grown man over weed.   Quick edit: I also want to add I have video of this
man on top of the teen. The slams happened so fast they couldn’t be recorded

It’s consistently the case (especially later at night) that the bus will be on
standby at the Forest Hills terminal (sometimes the tracking countdown will
randomly cease to exist), and the driver will only show up from the station to
actually drive it maybe 10-15 minutes after it’s scheduled to depart. Since the
bus is obviously right there, I don’t think you can blame this on traffic. It’s
extremely frustrating, does anyone know why this keeps happening?

Having ridden the red line my whole life, everyday to and from school and now to
and from work (even during the worst of the slow zones when a what normally was
a 31 minute ride took over an hour), I was really excited when the red line
fixed its last slow zone after all those shut downs.   Unfortunately on some
days the system is not much better. Every weekday I ride the same route on the
red line back and forth to work. These past couple of months, 8 out of those 10
times there has been some sort of delay or standby or what feels like the train
is crawling. Today for example we went super slow between Wollaston and North
Quincy, stood by at North Quincy, crawled between JFK and Andrew, lingered at
Andrew, and then again went slow between Andrew and Broadway. (The other two
times when it runs smoothly the whole way are great)  I know there are still
signal problems and other issues that need to be addressed, but it’s super
frustrating, especially when these delays make you miss a connecting bus that
you should’ve made with 10 minutes to spare on a normal day. And the
unpredictability is really frustrating. I can leave my house at the same time
each morning but depending on the red line, I can get to work anywhere from 9:50
to 10:20.   Anyway this is getting longer than I anticipated, but I’ll still use
the red line every day because I don’t have another option, I just wish it was
more consistent.

Since the topic of bus route ridership came up, I decided to take a look at
TransitMatters' Covid Recovery Dashboard (link:
[https://recovery.transitmatters.org/](https://recovery.transitmatters.org/) )
to see how the Bus Network Redesign (BNRD) Phase 1 routes have been doing
ridership-wise since the changes. Overall, the data trends are interesting but
generally positive and paint a good picture of how the new routes have been
doing.  First, **Route 86**, which was cut back to Harvard Square Station, had a
predictable drop in ridership. It lost about 2,000 daily riders, or about 15
riders per trip, in ridership, from 5,547 weekday riders per day on 12/17/2024
to 3,392 riders per day as of 2/3/2025 (I'll get into the weird inconsistencies
in data reporting through this dashboard later). Interestingly, the route had a
marginal increase in service, particularly at midday on weekdays, and all around
on Sundays (increased service was advertised, but not particularly when that
would be). Next, let's look at route 109 to see how that route's extension in
place of the 86 affected its ridership.  **Route 109** did indeed pick up Route
86's ridership, and more. The route nearly doubled in ridership, gaining over
3,000 new riders, and going from 3,224 riders per day as of 12/4/2024 to 7,596
riders as of 1/26/2025. This jump is interesting because it suggests that Route
109 not only gained Route 86's former Sullivan Square - Harvard Square ridership
but gained an added approximately 1,000 riders per day. There are three factors
that could have caused this:  * New connection created: the transfer ridership
between routes 104 and 109 and routes between Union Square and Sullivan Square
was anecdotally quite significant (the MBTA doesn't track this to my knowledge),
and even marginal through-riding ridership helps numbers.  * BNRD service
reconfigurations: again anecdotally, transfers between BNRD routes, particularly
in Everett Square with Routes 104 and 110, have been significant, especially
with Route 109 essentially taking the entire Sullivan Square to Everett Square
ridership of the 104. This factor is likely to subside somewhat as people adjust
to the new routes, as much of these transfers were those travelling from Ferry
Street on Route 104 to Sullivan Square and are largely already within walking
distance to Route 109 or to the Orange Line (or will simply choose to take Route
104 to the Orange Line).  * Service boost: The number of 109 trips more than
doubled with the BNRD from 48 to 98.5 weekday roundtrips. An interesting fact I
found in researching this is that the BNRD incidentally made Route 109 the most
frequent bus connection between Linden Square and the Orange Line, beating the
schedule-coordinated trunk of Routes 108, 411, and 430 to Malden Center by a
whopping 21 roundtrips (combined the three routes have 71 weekday trips). This
is likely the largest factor, but by far not the only one.  **Route 104**'s
ridership was practically unchanged with the BNRD, at least as of 1/26/2025.
However, this route will likely have the longest time between implementation and
adjustments in ridership pattern with the large changes to the route being made,
so looking back in a few months will likely be of far more use. Anecdotally,
ridership between Everett Square and Airport is very low, and some advertising
of its utility, particularly in its connections to the Mystic Mall, and quicker
connection between Chelsea and the Blue Line, would likely go a long way in
improving ridership.  **Route 110** may be the most direct proof the MBTA can
get that increasing bus service increases ridership, as its ridership has gone
up strongly with the BNRD, without any changes to the route or its connections.
Ridership jumped up 1,000 weekday riders per day from 3,005 as of 12/9/2024 to
4,266 as of 1/26/2025. This complements its more than 60% increase in service,
meaning that the route has likely been able to absorb the additional ridership
well.  Finally, **Route 116**'s ridership has interestingly seemed to drop
slightly. However, it appears that Wonderland - Maverick ridership was
decreasing in line with the current trend far before the BNRD. Part of this may
be because of poor service reliability, as particularly during rush hours trips,
even post-BNRD, buses tend to get stuck in traffic and bunch up, leading to
service that does not adequately service the route’s large market in a way
similar to Route 1.  Overall, the very preliminary data that we have suggests
that the Bus Network Redesign has met its goal in increasing service and bus
ridership. However, as previously mentioned, the data provided by
TransitMatters, which comes directly from the MBTA, isn't particularly
high-quality or recent, especially on smaller periods like examined here. A
review of these routes' ridership trends will likely yield far better data on
the success of the routes and be far better able to account for adjustments in
ridership patterns with the new routes. Additionally, examining the many bus
routes that connect to BNRD routes, which all did not change significantly,
would be of interest to study the effects that the BNRD could have on the
broader MBTA system.  Having taken all the BNRD routes myself, changes were
certainly needed, and from riding routes I could tell that despite there being
some frustration with the changes in the short term, there was optimism amongst
riders that things would be better. However, much of the promise of the BNRD
requires the MBTA to not fall into previous pitfalls seen on already frequent
buses, and active measures to avoid them, which I personally felt are not
present with Phase 1 routes and certainly add to riders' frustrations. If people
can rely on the bus to come under every 15 minutes, as this data hopefully shows
to some extent, they will take it, and much of the work the MBTA needs to do
isn't simply on having a bus there, but people being able to rely on it.

Title: Seeking your opinions/stories about the 15/16/1700 red line cars, and resources related to their history and design! I'm working on a retrospective send-off video of sorts

Hello everyone. A friend and I are working on a retrospective video about the
oldest cars on the red line: the 15 and 1600 series, built by Pullman Standard
(as well as the nearly identical UTDC 1700 series). I wanted to reach out and
get some opinions about the cars… How do you feel about their boxy, space aged
design? The rounded edges, the roll signs, the simple red, white, and stone gray
color scheme? And how do you reconcile the iconic design with the near-constant
reliability issues these cars cause riders? Does the sight of these cars
represent comfort and nostalgia, or is this overridden by a sense of
frustration? On the whole, are you excited or saddened by their impending
retirement (and replacement with the CRRC 1900s)? Let me know if your thoughts,
or any fun stories you have related to these cars! Finally, I was wondering if
anyone knows of good resources pertaining to the history, mechanical and
aesthetic design, specifications, or fun facts about these cars. This could
include specification sheets, diagrams, encyclopedia-style sources, historical
photos/videos, or any other cool resources/fun facts. I’m aiming for this to be
a light-hearted style video to give them a nice send-off of sorts as they’re
gradually replaced, and discuss the lessons that can be learned from operating
what are essentially rolling museums on a modern transit system!

It seems like there has been no recent news about the release of the Taskforce’s
report, especially at a time when the MBTA is facing major financial deficit
that the state will have to fund to maintain Eastern Massachusetts’ economy,
fend off a major traffic and housing crisis, and support low-income residents
who may not have any other way to get around Greater Boston.  It’s just
frustrating that Massachusetts is continuing their silence on the issue when
this could impact Massachusetts in almost every single issue that we are facing
right now, especially with the report supposedly being sent to Gov. Healey’s
desk by the end of the year.

**HERE IS WHAT TO KNOW**  * Glenn Inghram, 63, was walking in a crosswalk when
the bus took a left turn and ran him over, according to attorney Thomas Flaws of
Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah trial attorneys.  * From what we’ve seen, the turn
that the bus made into the crosswalk with a pedestrian in that crosswalk is a
violation of Massachusetts law, and we need to hold the MBTA responsible for
that,” Flaws said at a press conference in Boston Thursday.  * In an email
statement to Boston.com, the MBTA said it is “cooperating with the District
Attorney’s active investigation into the circumstances surrounding this
incident. Following safety-related incidents, it is standard procedure for
bus/train operators to be removed from service while the investigative process
advances,” the spokesperson wrote. “We send our condolences to the Inghram
family during this time.”  * Inghram was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center where he succumbed to his injuries.  * No charges have been filed in
Inghram's death.  * Nearby residents also wrote an open letter to the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Boston Public Works, Boston’s Chief
of Streets, and the MBTA, following Inghram’s death, asking for the agencies to
address safety concerns.  * The letter, signed by 695 Jamaica Plain, Forest
Hills, and Woodbourne residents, asks that the “dangerous and worsening
infrastructure” be addressed with “greater haste” and expresses residents’
frustration with the continued postponements of community outreach meetings
scheduled prior to the incident.  * Among those are a call to change the timing
of a walk signal, which currently goes green at the same time buses get a green
light to enter the intersection from the station, so that all vehicles have a
red light while pedestrians are in the crosswalk. Other suggested changes
include removing shrubbery that obstructs visibility, installing an additional
stoplight and curb extensions, and other improvements.  * Asked about the case
Thursday, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said "the city will work very closely with"
the T to support the investigation. "It's an incredible loss," she said, saying
she was "just so devastated alongside the family members, and we'll make sure
we're following through with them and with the MBTA to see what the city can
do."  **SOURCES IN RELATION TO THIS NEWS CAN BE FOUND BELOW:**  Boston.com:

Waited for three trains and decided to say fuck it and take a random C train to
Hynes cause I value not getting crushed by a train door and keeping my arms and
maybe just maybe catch the 39. MBTA gave me false hope that I could make it.
Nope missed it by 1 minute and the next one wasn’t for 25 minutes, at this point
would’ve been faster just to walk for an hour and a half ☹️ Ik it’s the orange

Title: MBTA BREAKING NEWS | No Green Line service between North Station, Union Square, and Medford/Tufts until further notice after a major derailment of a Type 8 car near Lechmere.

**INITIAL REPORT: 6:30 PM, OCTOBER 1st, 2024**  The derailment happened at 10
Morgan Ave. shortly after 5 p.m.   Reports states that the Type 8 train may have
rode over a switch and was promptly derailed off of the tracks.  A passenger on
board who was heading home from work told Newscenter5 that it felt like the
train jolted forward and then back as the train derailed. The passenger also
says that one woman appeared to have been thrown forward and looked to have
scrapes on her hands and arms.  Several people were being evaluated for
non-life-threatening injuries, according to an X post from the Cambridge Fire
Department.  Cambridge Fire says that they are working to disable the overhead
catenary power to the train, however all passengers have been removed and are
being evaluated.  The DPU and FTA are being notified of the derailment with
further investigation by the FTA and MBTA to be done soon to determine the
extract reason for the derailment.  This will be the 3rd major vehicle
derailment this year after a Red Line train derailed at Broadway and a Green
Line train derailed at Kenmore.   **UPDATE AT 7:12 PM**  —via CBS Boston—  * The
derailment happened on the eastbound tracks at the Red Bridge.  * Approximately
50 riders evacuated themselves onto the tracks and walked to an emergency exit.
* The cause of the derailment is under investigation. The tracks are being
assessed for damaged as crews work to re-rail the train.    * Six injuries were
reported, but seven people were taken to medical facilities for treatment.   *
As of 5:49 p.m. on Tuesday, the department said firefighters were removing
electrical power from the derailed train.  * "The MBTA sincerely apologizes to
riders for the frustration and distress this incident has caused," the MBTA said
in a statement. "We are committed to thoroughly investigating this matter to
ensure this does not happen again."  **UPDATE AT 7:19 PM**  —via Cambridge Day
and Green Line rider Aaron Berkowitz, who was in the train at the time of
derailment—  * We were just moving along when there was a thud, like a normal
thud – but then it kept going,” Berkowitz said. As the train left the rails and
hit gravel, and movement got rougher, “I grabbed the rail to keep myself from
bouncing around.” Smoke began to fill the car, though it was brief.  * The
roughly 30 riders got off and “for a while we were kind of milling around,”
Berkowitz said. As be began to walk back toward Lechmere station, MBTA workers
showed up to redirect riders to a back road away from tracks. Firefighters and
police also arrived.  * The conductor was heard saying the steering failed. “I
heard her saying ‘it wouldn’t turn right.’ It was at a point where the track
splits,” Berkowitz said.  * A photo by rider Aaron Berkowitz, who was heading
toward his home by Union Square, shows the green line train running off the
rails and knocking down equipment. No one appeared injured, Berkowitz said, and
the incident was “not as violent as one would expect from the phrase ‘train
derailment.’”  **UPDATE AT 7:33 PM**  —via NBC Boston—  * The MBTA says at about
5 p.m., the wheels of the lead trolley of a Green Line train were reported to
have come off the tracks, causing the train to derail near Lechmere Station
eastbound at the Red Bridge. Around 50 passengers self-evacuated onto the
tracks, where they had to walk back to an emergency exit located in the track
area.  * The MBTA said work crews were also responding to investigate, assess
any damage, and re-rail the train.  * The root cause of Tuesday's derailment
wasn't immediately known and is under investigation.  * The Department of Public
Utilities and the Federal Transit Administration have been notified.  **UPDATE
AT 8:25 PM**  —via NBC Boston—  * **MBTA Chief Operating Officer Ryan Coholan
will be holding a press conference at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in front of the main
entrance of Lechmere Station to address the Green Line incident. You can watch
it on NBC Boston.**  **UPDATE AT 8:44 PM**  **MAJOR NOTES FROM THE PRESS
CONFERENCE:**  •       ⁠The MBTA has determined that the track was not the
reason for the train derailing.  •       ⁠The T is now looking into human
factors that could have caused the derailments. (i.e: the operator of the train
may have not followed proper operating procedures)  •       ⁠The T has stated
that service on the Green Line Extension should resume by tomorrow morning.  •
⁠The T will take the train to a nearby repair facility for further
investigations into the train.  * The MBTA is now working on rerailing the train
and conducting their investigation into the cause of the derailment.   * The
train derailed near the Red Bridge Interlocking, where the Medford/Tufts and
Union Square branches meet near Lechmere.   * Any track that was damaged will
need to be repaired before service resumes.   **UPDATE AT 9:41 PM**  —via NBC
Boston—  * Coholan initially said at his press conference that he anticipated
regular service to resume Wednesday morning, saying that following re-railing,
they would thoroughly inspect the tracks again and then the vehicle would go to
one of their maintenance facilities for a thorough investigation. However, after
the press conference ended, MBTA officials were informed that the National
Transportation Safety Board is getting involved with the investigation, which
would halt the MBTA's efforts to clear up the tracks.   * The tracks will most
likely be closed Wednesday, Coholan later said.  * Shuttles are still in place
until further notice between North Station, Union Square, and Medford/Tufts.
Assuming that service does not resume Wednesday, your best chance for service
will be heading to Kendall/MIT or Central on the Red Line, Community College or
Sullivan on the Orange Line, using local buses, or West Medford on the Lowell
Commuter Rail line.  **UPDATE AT 10:38 PM**  —via Boston Globe—  * Late Tuesday
night, MBTA officials announced that investigators from the National
Transportation Safety Board were en route to the scene, and the T’s
investigation had to stop until they arrived.  * A spokesperson for the NTSB
said in an email to the Globe that the federal agency had been informed of the
derailment and was “gathering information,” but inspectors had not yet
responded.  **UPDATE AT 6:16 AM, OCTOBER 2ND, 2024**   —via NBC Boston—  * The
MBTA has continued shuttling passengers between North Station, Union Square, and
Medford/Tufts after the NTSB forced the MBTA to stop all repairs/investigations
so that the agency can conduct their own investigation.  * The derailed train
remains derailed on the elevated track, and the National Transportation Safety
Board is now running the investigation.  **UPDATE AT 10:24 AM**  —via South
Coast Today—  * A MBTA spokesperson said in a statement to the USA Today Network
that "an estimate for restoring service is still being developed" but the agency
will provide updates when more information is available.  * The NTSB
investigation is expected to begin Wednesday, a spokesperson said in a statement
to the USA Today Network. "A team of NTSB investigators are expected to be on
scene today," a NTSB spokesperson said. "Once on site, the investigator will
begin the process of documenting the scene and examining the train cars and
equipment involved."  **UPDATE AT 10:46 AM**  —via Boston Globe—  * Federal
investigators are expected to soon begin documenting the scene of Tuesday’s
Green Line derailment in Cambridge, examining the train cars and equipment
involved, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said.   *
During the investigation, the agency will not speculate about the cause of the
accident.  * Based on initial reports, “there does not appear to be any impact
to foreign objects or other equipment,” the National Transportation Safety Board
said in an emailed statement, but noted that the derailment remains under
investigation.  * There was no immediate timetable for when normal train service
will resume.  * The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigation
involveslooking at the “human, machine, and the operating environment.”  *
Investigators will gather a number of records and information, including image
and event recorders from the locomotive, track maintenance and inspection
records, signal data, witness statements, and a 72-hour background of the crew
to determine “if there were any issues that could have affected the
operator/engineer’s ability to safety operate the train,” the agency said.  *
Witnesses to the derailment are asked to contact the agency.  * A preliminary
report will be available within 30 days, while a final report, which will detail
the probable cause of the crash and any contributing factors, is expected to be
released between one and two years from now, the federal agency said.   **UPDATE
AT 11:23 AM**  —via MBTA—  **GM ENG’s STATEMENT REGARDING DERAILMENT**  “We
apologize for this unfortunate incident, to the riders who were aboard this
Green Line trolley yesterday, and to riders who continue to be disrupted by the
shut down,” said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng. “Safety continues to
be our top priority and this incident is unacceptable. We’re working alongside
our federal and state partners to understand what happened to make sure this
doesn’t happen again. We know this unplanned service change is a challenge, and
we thank our riders for their patience at this time.”   **MBTA’s STATEMENT
REGARDING DERAILMENT**  The MBTA and its regulatory partners are investigating
this incident. Once the investigation is complete and the area is returned to
the T, infrastructure and maintenance personnel will make all repairs necessary
to restore service.  The MBTA is working collaboratively with the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as well as its federal and state oversight
partners at the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities (DPU) while investigations are underway to
determine the root cause. The MBTA is committed to taking any and all actions
necessary following these investigations to ensure this incident is not
repeated, and welcomes all post-incident direction from the NTSB, FTA, and DPU.
The MBTA also recognizes that any unplanned service change is challenging for
our riders – we apologize for this inconvenience and frustration. More
information will be released as it becomes available.    **UPDATE AT 3:30 PM**
**Service on the GLX will remain suspended until further notice due to the
ongoing investigation by the NTSB and FTA.**  **UPDATE AT 7:31 PM**  * The MBTA
is currently in the process of moving the derailed train out of the area, so
service is expected to resume within the next day or two.   **UPDATE AT 8:11
PM**  —via GBH—  **GOV. HEALEY’s RESPONSE TO DERAILMENT**  * Less than two years
after the full Green Line Extension first brought service to Medford, Gov. Maura
Healey addressed Tuesday’s derailment and said the track did not appear to be to
blame.   “When we came in as an administration, we had to redo the Green Line
Extension because it wasn’t done correctly the first time,” she said. “We redid
that and that rail is good.”   While investigators examined the aftermath of the
derailment, Healey acknowledged the shock of what passengers went through.  “I
can imagine the horror with that incident and I’m really sorry that people were
injured,” she said.  * The National Transportation Safety Board will be on the
scene for three to five days, a spokesperson told GBH News.  * According to the
MBTA, the wheels of the lead trolley came off the tracks, causing one car to
derail.  —via Boston 25–  As part of the [investigation, NTSB] investigators
will gather the following information and records:  •     Image recorders/event
recorders (if available) from the locomotive  •     Track maintenance/inspection
records  •     Signal data  •     Train car maintenance and inspection records
•     Braking system inspection and maintenance records  •     Railcars consist
•     Weather forecasts and actual weather and lighting conditions around the
time of the accident  •     Review dispatch procedures  •     72-hour background
of the crew to determine if there were any issues that could have affected the
operator/engineer’s ability to safety operate the train  •     Witness
statements  •     Electronic devices that could contain information relevant to
the investigation  •     Any available surveillance video, including from
doorbell cameras  * NTSB investigators arrived on scene Wednesday around noon.

Title: Genuine question, why do trains go on standy instead of express?

I've been on a few green line rides lately where something happened to cause at
least 10-15 mins headway before I got on the train, only for us to wait on
standby for a good 5 minutes. If there was a holdup (one of these was a car
crash by Huntington and Fenwood last Friday that blocked the E line for 20 mins)
I get running one express and having people get on the next one, but I really
wanna know what possible reason they have for creating even more headway up
ahead of a delayed train? The MBTA site showed a bunch of trains on the stretch
behind us so wouldn't express have made far more sense?  Even more frustrating
on last week specifically, they ran some "test trains" and "no service" through
that we had to watch pass as more and more of us were waiting for a train that
would actually take us downtown. What's the point of running empty trains
through after a delay and then making the first one to carry people again wait
another 5 mins on standby at a station? If there's an actual reason, im
genuinely curious.

Via WBUR.  TDLR version:  * The 31-member task force is running out of time and
its mission appears to have shifted (from the initial mission of the task force
when first launched in March): Instead of a detailed plan on how to finance the
system and keep it healthy for the long haul, transportation officials seem to
be bracing stakeholders to expect just a "list" from the task force.  * At a
late July update for the MBTA board, the state’s undersecretary of
transportation, Hayes Morrison, said the task force was now working to create a
“toolkit” — essentially a list, which would include “sources and uses,” Morrison
said, or a roster of potential revenue sources and places where the money is
needed.  * The T board’s chair, Thomas Glynn, asked Morrison if the task force
would still be advising on spending priorities. Morrison's response: “We don't
think so … it’s possible, but we haven’t discussed that yet.” When they heard
about the undersecretary’s update, many on the task force — a who's-who of
leading figures in transit policy, state government, housing, health and
business — were frustrated.  * Among them is MBTA Advisory Board Executive
Director Brian Kane. He said when he was tapped to join the task force, he was
told the group would identify specific projects and programs to raise funds for
transportation needs. And they are working to do just that, he said. He doubts a
“list” meets the mandate. “I think it's on us to meet the charge that [Healey]
has given us through the executive order to make solid recommendations and, and
provide solid facts and data,” Kane said. “A toolkit, which I still don't really
understand what that means, I don't think does that.”   * In a statement,
MassDOT did not address the specific concerns of task force members. A
spokesperson said the mission of the task force has not changed: "Together, the
members are exploring what’s needed to create a safe, reliable, equitable and
efficient transportation system for all residents and employers currently and
for generations to come."  * In March, a month after the task force was formed,
the state hired consulting giant Ernst &amp; Young for hundreds of thousands of
dollars, to assist on the project. This came as a surprise to some on the task
force.  * Several members of the group told WBUR they are not clear how the task
force’s work and the work of the consulting firm will merge. Amie Shei, a task
force member and chief executive of The Health Foundation of Central
Massachusetts, said the consultants have been working “independently” of the
task force. “I assume they've been working closely with the co-chairs and the
staff, but as a task force, we have not seen or heard any formal presentations
from the consultants in recent months,” Shei said.  * A MassDOT spokesperson
said the task force will "discuss, shape and develop the final deliverable." But
the members, like Kane, have said it isn't clear what role the consultants will
have in the report sent to the governor. Kane said he would not stand by
analysis that's prepared by Ernst &amp; Young for the task force to simply
rubber stamp. Massachusetts doesn’t need another consultant-driven report
identifying problems and possible solutions of the transportation system, he
said; “that work has been done many, many times over over the last 20 years."  *
Shei, of the task force, said, “We actually haven't considered any concrete
[funding] options. And, you know, we also haven't been told that certain options
are off the table."  * According to MassDOT, no official meeting minutes are
being kept. [MassDOT Secretary] Tibbits-Nutt says the group has been holding
additional meetings to examine transportation funding options. The task force
meets twice a month, once as a full group and then in smaller "focus groups."  *
People closely following the task force's progress, like Reggie Ramos, executive
director of the advocacy group Transportation for Massachusetts, are now also
concerned. In an interview, she said there had been “a lot of hope” that
Healey’s creation of the task force by executive order meant there would be real
recommendations at the end of the nearly year-long assignment. But now, she
worries concrete advice from the task force has been sidelined. “The fear is
this becomes a benign, aimless list that just exists and does not do anything,”
Ramos said.

Title: Winthrop sends letter to MBTA and MassDOT, asking to separate Quincy-Winthrop ferry and year-long service.

Article by the Winthrop Transcript is being cited, with the most important
details being copied in.   **TLDR Version:**  * The Winthrop Town Council has
expressed its frustration with MassDOT and the MBTA over the operation of the
Winthrop ferry service.  * Tuesday night, the council approved sending a letter
to MassDOT Secretary Monica Tibbets-Nutt and MBTA Executive Director Phillip Eng
outlining some of the town’s concerns, including the need to separate the
Winthrop service from the Quincy service, and a request to make ferry service a
year-round affair.  * During the Sumner Tunnel closure, the letter states that
Winthrop residents have been turned away from the boat as it has reached
capacity.  * The council also raised concerns about the condition and care of
the Valkyrie ferry boat, which was given to the MBTA last year after the town
installed two new motors and made other improvements.  * The council stated that
the MBTA has a long history of undeserving Winthrop despite the amount of
payments the town makes to the T. The limited avenues for people to get in and
out of the town was also raised as a concern.  * At Tuesday night’s meeting,
several residents spoke in favor of the town’s position on the ferry service and
the general lack of service from the MBTA. “We are historically underserved, and
we stand to be even less served if the proposed changes under the bus network
redesign come to fruition,” said Julia Wallerce. “That’s not until phase three,
it’s unfunded, it may never happen, but the sentiment is there that Winthrop is
generally underappreciated by our transit agency. I want to commend Senator
Edwards and Representative Turco for getting the T to operate our ferry service,
but it sucks, we deserve better, it clearly prioritizes Quincy over Winthrop,
which the letter makes very clear, we are a waterlogged community and we need
water transit that works.”

job-related frustrations that I know nothing about. I feel like bus driving is a
very noble civil service even though sometimes it feels like people don't
appreciate it!  if you are a bus driver: thank you so much! if you are a fellow

(Disclaimer, I do work in the Transit Industry, but not at the MBTA so things
may be slightly different--here is my take)  Things people do not understand:  *
Trains are not like buses. Trains cannot pass each other. If a train is so late
that it will not make the next scheduled departure the opposite direction, the
only way to make up time is for it to go express. This occurs at other transit
agencies as well. * **The street-running portion of the E Line is where all the
delays happen.** Trains literally share the road with cars and get stuck into
traffic. Since the GLX portion is connected with this, obviously it will be
impacted. * The central tunnel is over capacity. This is also where delays
happen. Of course trains are going to bunch by the time they reach the GLX. *
And most frustratingly: **SOMERVILLE ASKED FOR THIS. They asked for a 1-seat
ride from Somerville to the Longwood Medical area. And this comes with the E
Branch traffic issues.**    * A solution that would 100% solve the delays would
be using a loop at Government center and only running trains Medford--Government
center. However, this would cause *yet another article*, about how Longwood area
is no longer a 1-seat ride from Somerville.  And I say this as someone who lives
in Somerville. Anyone with a brain knew that the Green Line is unpredictable
once it gets downtown. Should have made a branch of the orange line as the
extension.  The article in question:
[https://www.cambridgeday.com/2024/07/26/unreliability-is-a-drag-on-value-of-the-green-line-finally-coming-to-somerville-leaders-tell-mbta/](https://www.cambridgeday.com/2024/07/26/unreliability-is-a-drag-on-value-of-the-green-line-finally-coming-to-somerville-leaders-tell-mbta/)
EDIT: For those commenting that trains shouldn't go express and that late trains
should instead turn at North station instead: either way you are dumping
passengers, so what have you really solved? At least going "express" gets some
passengers to where they want to go. Dumping people at north station to reverse
doesn't do anything.

1. ) The T is in the process of hiring 16 fare engagement officers who will
start interacting with riders of buses and the Green Line by early winter, the
agency said previously. Later, the officers will begin writing tickets for
people who have not paid fares. The citations will start with a written warning,
then escalate to $50 for the second, third, and fourth offenses, then $100 for
the fifth and any subsequent offenses within a three-year period.  2.) Most
people at the station, though, were not using the new reader. One person
repeatedly tapped their Charlie Card on the scanner, hoping it would let them,
and grew increasingly frustrated as it did not. While most people were not using
the new payment method on its first day, they had opinions about tap-to-go. Some
thought it would be great for the public and increase ridership. Others were
indifferent, especially because the New York MBTA rolled out contactless payment
in 2019. [Some] were skeptical of the upgrade’s practicality and unsure if it’s
better than a monthly pass.  3.) All-door boarding on buses, which is expected
to speed up travel, will be coming at a later date.  4.) Governor Maura Healey
descended the flight of stairs at Park Street Station on Thursday morning to try
the MBTA’s new “tap-to-go” payment method for buses and subways. She was holding
a press conference at the station where the occasional T worker or rider passed
by the crowd. Healey said the contactless payment modernized the T made it
easier to use and more accessible for riders.  5.) The new contactless payment
system was supposed to replace the MBTA’s old fare collection system by 2021
under a more than $700 million contract with San Diego-based Cubic Corp. and
United Kingdom-based financier John Laing. But technological glitches with the
Cubic fare readers and other problems, in 2020, pushed back implementation and
raised the cost of the project to nearly $1 billion.  6.) The next phase, which
the T said will be rolled out next spring, will include new CharlieCards and new
vending machines, for people who don’t have credit cards or smartphones, or
simply prefer the existing system. Paying via cash on board will also remain an
option. By the spring of 2026, the T said, riders will also be able to use their
credit cards and phones to board commuter rail trains and ferries.  **Article is

Title: MBTA is pushing back against some of the notes that the State Auditor’s office did in their most recent audit. (TLDR from WBUR)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new report from Auditor Diana DiZoglio's office flagged several issues with
the MBTA's frontline customer service team, who are often found wearing red
shirts in stations, provided by private vendor Block by Block (BBB). T officials
pushed back on some of the findings, writing that one of the major takeaways
relied on a flawed methodology.  In an audit that covered the period from Jan.
1, 2021 through Dec. 31, 2022, DiZoglio's office found that BBB personnel
completed the number of station checks the MBTA sought — two per hour — on only
6% of staffed, contracted days.  MBTA officials, who have ramped up their
attention on station conditions under General Manager Phil Eng, replied that
although the agency "encourages and requests" two to four station checks per
hour, that threshold is "not a contractual requirement." The agency also said
DiZoglio's team deployed a methodology that "negatively skews the data."  "For
example, if a second station inspection was conducted one minute after the hour,
the [auditor's office] nonetheless considered that hour to be a failure," the T
wrote in its response to the audit. "BBB staffed approximately 646,000 base
hours during the audit period at various stations. A total of 1,743,971 total
station checks were conducted during that same period, averaging to
approximately 2.4 station checks per hour staffed."  officials told DiZoglio's
office they did in fact provide documentation that all 60 employees in that
sample "were trained on operations and safety before being assigned to any
independent shifts at subway stations." Some of the gaps, they said, appeared to
be a result of incorrectly recorded deployment dates rather than insufficient
training.  But the auditor's office said the evidence provided by the MBTA "was
not sufficient."  "In April 2024, the MBTA provided us with sign-in sheets
documenting the date of safety training along with each BBB employee's
signature. We were able to trace all but two BBB employees to sign-in sheets,"
auditors wrote. "The MBTA also provided us four Microsoft Excel spreadsheets,
one of which was created in April 2024, as purported evidence of operations
training that the MBTA indicated occurred in 2021 and 2022. The remaining three
had been edited in April 2024. We were unable to substantiate whether these
spreadsheets were altered prior to receiving them. This is unsatisfactory, as
one of the documents was created two to three years after the training was
reportedly conducted, while the others were edited prior to delivery to OSA and
do not provide proof that the training occurred."  The audit published Sunday is
the first in a series of reports DiZoglio's office prepared about its work
examining safety and performance at the T, whose safety failures in recent years
drew intense scrutiny from federal regulators and frustrated riders across the
system.

I understand the struggles of the MBTA--and really appreciate we have service on
the CR outside of rush hour--but why is it that almost every train I've seen or
taken lately has been severely delayed outside of the mornings and evenings? I
try to take the train somewhere during the middle of the day when I have time,
but it has seemed that recently every train between 11:00am-3:00pm has been
delayed by at least 5-15 minutes.  Just as I'm typing this right now, a
Worcester bound CR train is about 15 minutes delayed and has gotten more delayed
as I'm writing this. I'm not frustrated, but am wondering if mid-day service
trains have gotten more delayed on average recently. Maybe I've just gotten
unlucky.

Every day it feels like the departure times for the 96 bus are more and more
inaccurate, and there are never reasons given for the delays. Is it that hard to
either have the buses leave at their stated times or change the stated times to
when the bus is actually going to leave? This is why bus ridership is so low --
it's impossible to count on the bus showing up anywhere near its stated time, if
at all, and seeing the bus sitting in a parking lot, driver and all, but not
leaving is incredibly frustrating. Has anyone else been experiencing this?

I was reviewing the MBTA’s proposed FY 2025/29 CIP May 7th meeting when I was
absolutely baffled by the words coming from the head of the MBTA’s regional rail
transformation office.  It is abundantly clear from choice words such as “cheap,
quick, and minimized infrastructure” to describe a unproven service model
without any other considerations for holistic needs such as power systems,
facilities, station accessibility, etc.   The lack of ANY understanding of how
regional rail systems work globally and the complete lack of comparable service
models comes off as unprofessional; here a few choice highlights.  - “the system
is too large to electrify with overhead catenary”; I…. don’t even have any words
for this  - “DMUs don’t exist in North America”; this is just outright wrong,
and if this referring to non-FRA compliant DMUs [this is even more
wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma%E2%80%93Marin_Area_Rail_Transit)  -
“add batteries to existing models of electric multiple units” yea, [the LIRR
already tried and failed with
this.](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/long-island-rail-road-ends-development-of-battery-electric-equipment/).
This whole scheme also stinks of [Vivarail, which is another rabbit
hole.](https://www.therailwayhub.co.uk/66786/operators-reveal-their-plans-following-vivarail-collapse/)
- “battery-electric can be delivered faster and cheaper”; keep in mind North
America currently has NO operating BEMUs in operation yet. [TransitMatters has
also done an analysis that stipulated that battery electrification would
actually be more
costly](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/533b9a24e4b01d79d0ae4376/t/65df66bb0eddd103953aaac2/1709139646039/TransitMatters-Modernizing+Framingham+Worcester+Line.pdf)
Honestly there’s so much more here to go over, but it’s honestly just
discouraging.  I can go on and on about their take on dual-modes or what other
“comparable systems” he alludes to you, but I’ll leave that discussion up to
ya’ll. It honestly feels like the future of regional rail is being astroturfed
by close-minded, baseless assumptions that don’t consider what other countries
have done.

At the Gilman Square green line station, the trains to Heath Street often say
"every 7 to 13 minutes" rather than an actual ETA. I'm curious - Why doesn't it
show the actual ETAs or delay statuses more often? (It seems like the outbound
direction shows ETAs more often than inbound.)  I'm also curious about why the E
trains sometimes don't stop when they're announced as arriving? (Not out of
service trains, but ones with passengers and seats). What are some of the
challenges that prevent schedule changes from being announced on the signs or
intercom?  In one example yesterday, the signs said a Heath St train was
arriving. Train rolled through the station without stopping, even though there
are passengers and seats available on board. Later, signs announce that the next
train is arriving. The arriving train just rolls through the station without
stopping again, with passengers and open seats. Eventually another train came
(unannounced) and actually stopped. I'd love to understand the context so it's
less frustrating in the moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this week’s discussion topic, I want to talk about this article I found on
WBUR.   This articles focuses on how Greater Bostonians feel about the MBTA
system as a whole.  We first hear from Stephanie Liu from Cambridge, who has
basically given up on the Red Line and has decided to use the 1 bus (which is
the most bunched, delayed, and crowded buses in the entire system):   * “The Red
Line's so slow, there's just closures everywhere,” Liu said. “And I just refuse
to sit on the Red Line or the Green Line anymore. I moved because I didn't want
to take the Red line to school anymore… “ (taking to Eng) Fix the T system," she
said. "Like, we live in a city and we pay a lot of taxes and the T system
shouldn't be as broken as it is.”  I understand Liu’s concern as a Red Line
rider. The Red Line has gotten worse over the last year. However, this would not
be surprising when you realize the state has not adequately funded the T for 3
decades and has not placed those who are advocates for transit or has actually
worked in the transit sector in leadership positions. This is something that
should be more blamed on the state than on leadership.   I will say that the
amount of safety-related concerns that has happened is very concerning, however.
Eng needs to do a better job in this regard.    We also see that when Eng
started, there were 230 speed restrictions in place across the T system and on
his one-year anniversary, there were 116. This means that the Track Improvement
Program is actually working, with the understanding that there *will be slow
zones that may reappear*.  We also hear from Katie Calandriello from
TransitMatters:  “‘Katie Calandriello, policy analyst and program manager for
the nonprofit TransitMatters, said the group is ‘really excited’ about Eng’s
leadership and the initiative he's shown with the track improvement plan. But
she said the T has to do a better job communicating about repair-related service
disruptions. ‘There's still, like, riders that are showing up and have no idea
that the diversion is happening,’ Calandriello said.’”  I think that the MBTA
subreddit is trying to help do this by condensing information and pinning any
shutdown notices to the top of the page so that riders can see this. I would
also say that the T posts shutdowns notices in station through audio
announcements, screen PSAs, and online. I don’t exactly agree with this comment,
but I do think that the T can help make these notices more apparent by placing
notices across stations.  We also hear from Dorchester resident and Red Line
rider Woody Hayward:   “…He's been frustrated with communication around train
arrivals for the better part of the year. ‘Sometimes the little signs like
gaslight you or they're like, 'the train's going to be here in 10 minutes' and
you're like, 'OK, cool,' and then two or three minutes go by and it still says
10 minutes. And you're like, 'now they're just lying,' he said. Hayward and his
wife Rebecca said they pad their travel time by 15 minutes or prefer to walk
when they need to reach a destination on time. Despite that, Rebecca Hayward
said the T is ‘better than it was at the worst, but it seems like it's slow
progress. There's still a lot of issues to work out’”.  I do agree with this
point. The headways on the Red Line are really bad, and hopefully redesigning
the Alewife crossover and removing all slow zones will help increase service,
although things such as signals, people holding up the train, and other types of
delays will still cause these delays anyways. Slow progress is still progress,
however, so we should celebrate the small wins.  What do you guys think about
this article?  As always, stay proactive and safe!

Title: “Pass Already Used”

Has anyone gotten an error when tapping your Charlie card if you have a monthly
pass? I often tap my card and it will say “see agent.” This happens several
times a week, often multiple times in a row. Most of the time the pass will
eventually work, but sometimes I will say “pass already used.” Sometimes the
MBTA agent will just let me though, sometimes I can follow behind someone else,
but this is incredibly frustrating when I pay for the pass every month. Has
anyone else had this issue? I’m skeptical that a new Charlie card would fix the
issue, because it does work 99% of the time.

I park at Alewife sometimes, started parking there in January and some days I
forget to pay the $9 daily parking fee. On Friday I received an invoice from the
MBTA. It showed 8 unpaid days with tickets worth $80. I knew that didn’t sound
right so I cross checked with the PaybyPhone receipts that I have in my email
and 6/8 were paid for. Today I tried to appeal the 6 tickets and that is when I
realized it’s only up to 30 days. 30 days was yesterday which is frustrating
considering I only got this invoice two days ago.   Does anyone know how to
appeal this considering it’s technically passed due? Will try calling customer
service tomorrow so fingers crossed.   Update: I was finally able to speak to a
rep who accepted my PaybyPhone receipts and also waived the late fees :)

Hello! I take the commuter rail to work and lately it’s been 30 minutes late to
get to Back Bay in the morning. When I check the schedule it mentions “switching
issues”. Does anyone know if they’re going to do anything to fix it soon? It
being late makes me 20 minutes late to work, which then causes an issue coming
back. I’m thinking maybe I should take an earlier train into work if this is
going to just continue. It’s frustrating because it still gets to T.F. Green at
7:19 am and leaves a minute or two later.

Title: MBTA manager Phillip Eng also wants a better T: 'There is more work ahead'

Some key notes from the article:  * “MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng wants a
better T. But he’s aware of what he’s up against, with aging infrastructure, a
string of safety problems and a strained budget”.  * “Riders have shown
frustration with diversions. Eng said he’s experienced the diversions himself in
his commute, switching from the Green Line to the Orange Line at North Station
to get to the MBTA’s headquarters at 10 Park Plaza. I see, and I observe, and
every diversion that we do, we're looking to see how we can improve upon that,”
Eng said. “The worst thing we can continue to do is have bad service, slow
service”’.  * “Along with rider frustrations, the MBTA is also facing worker
safety concerns. On Jan. 8, a worker had a “near miss” incident on the Green
Line, in which workers were on the tracks while a train was running. Eng
attributed at least some of the safety incidents to increased reporting. “I
think what you're seeing is our employees speaking up to share these occurrences
and perhaps what was happening is that not every single incident was being
reported before,” he said”’.  * “As a pandemic-era pilot of fare-free bus
service on some routes within Boston comes to an end, Eng said he’s been looking
at ways to make fare more affordable to low-income riders. “But I also know that
I have to look forward to the future and making sure that I put us on the road
to be much more fiscally balanced year to year,” Eng said. “And there's a long
way to go. But I'm really excited about the support that I've gotten to date,
and I really thank the governor and administration for all of that”’.

I've had the discounted MBTA youth pass for over a year now and I've noticed
something strange when I go to reload my card. Sometimes when I tap on a fare
vending machine it looks pretty much the same as the normal charlie cards and
gives me the option to buy discounted monthly passes, weekly passes, or to just
load on money and pay for each individual ride. I used to get the monthly passes
when I was taking the T every day but now it makes more sense financially to pay
for each individual ride. Sometimes when I tap my card at the machines it only
gives me the option to purchase a monthly pass and won't let me refill it with
money. The box to load money on is greyed out and it won't let me select it. I
noticed it happens more often towards the end of the month, so I originally
thought it was to encourage people to buy the passes for the upcoming month, but
I tried to refill it on the 17th recently and I ran into the same issue. I just
have to try a different day and hope it will let me load more money on and it's
really frustrating. There's nothing about this on the MBTA website. Has anyone
else had this issue?

TLDR: Just had a lady at Central Southbound randomly walk up to me and try to
light me on fire, so just be aware of that. Already reported it to Transit
Police.  I was waiting for the Ashmont train, just standing there watching
Tiktoks with my earbuds in so I didn’t notice her approaching until she stopped
about 3 feet from me, held up a dollar store spray bottle and a lighter and
just. Spritzed a couple little sprays of fire at me. Didnt do much, only went
about 6 inches and I was so confused I just stared at her. A bit embarrassing
honestly.  She seems frustrated, walks away to sit on a suitcase and starts
refilling her spray bottle with rubbing alcohol from a target bag. As if that
was the problem and not her really dumb method. It’s not as easy to light people
on fire as she thinks it is, especially since alcohol burns off so fast. I
really only noticed her because I felt the heat distantly.  She didn’t get on
the train, so I reported it and they said they were going to handle her. She’s
probably gone, but just watch out for a black woman in a gray outfit with a pink
suitcase I guess. Weirdest encounter I’ve ever had on the RL.   Never change,

Phil Eng announced last week that the GLX would undergo a branch wide slowzone
as crews determined that rail tracks were built too close together. Many
passengers I’ve spoken with are frustrated with a ride from Tufts to North
Station taking as long as 45 minutes. This weekend the GLX is under criticism
again, two trains derailed at East Somerville on Saturday and Sunday and many
trains were cited as “disabled” at Science Park, Medford/Tufts, and North
Station, causing upwards of 45 minute delays on Sunday. The question remains how
can a project of almost a decade crumble when the branch just opened under a
year ago? We will have to see what happens over the next month as we expect the
GM and BoD to announce a monthlong shutdown for repairs to the branch at some
point between November and December or Spring 2024.

I travel to a decent amount of large cities &amp; always make a point to try out
the public transit. Granted I'm usually just there for a few days, but I've yet
to encounter a system as frustrating as the MBTA. I'm sure New Yorkers &amp;
Chicagoans could find plenty to complain about the MTA &amp; CTA, but they dwarf
the MBTA in frequency/reliability. I've even had good experiences with the DC
Metro &amp; SEPTA.  Even just north of us in Montreal (granted outside the US),
I was shocked by how fast/frequent the trains were. Just missed one? No worries
- there's another in 3 minutes. &amp; they're absolutely flying up to the
station &amp; departing it. I swear I couldn't even k myself with the red line
if I wanted to.   Another thing I've noticed is that these cities are **much**
better at handling events than the MBTA is. Cant count the number of times I've
watched trains go by at Kenmore or North Station &amp; just said "welp that's
how it goes when there's a game" as if MBTA officials don't have access to a Red
Sox schedule. Post-MLS game in MTL &amp; post-Cubs game in CHI, the platform was
filled with officials shepherding people to where they need to be &amp; they
clearly increased the train frequency to handle the crush.  Lastly, I have an
easier time navigating other systems as a tourist at times than I do navigating
a system I take several times a week. First time I took the ferry to East
Boston, there was basically one sign telling me I was sorta in the right area.
Would it kill them to put more signs up on the docks &amp; one on the ferry so
every single person doesn't have to ask "does this one go to Eastie?". Imagine
being a tourist trying to get to Tufts on the GLX. Half the maps are telling you
that your stop doesn't even exist!!!  What really bothers me is that the latter
two paragraphs require little to no capital investment to improve upon. I think
it really illustrates how little MBTA officials care. &amp; I'm sick of hearing
that we actually have it pretty good just because the absolute bare-minimum
exists.

The MBTA has removed a driver from its RIDE service after a passenger with
cerebral palsy said the man turned what should have been a routine trip from
Malden to a Rotary Club meeting in Wakefield into a frustrating hours-long
ordeal, and repeatedly refused to take him home during the journey.  The
driver’s behavior was so unusual and troubling that a RIDE dispatcher took the
step of advising James Norris, the passenger, to call 911 for help, he said.
"Listen, he is going to be written up,” the dispatcher said of the driver,
according to Norris. "But if you feel the need to call 911 and talk to the
police, you’re well within your rights to do so. ... We encourage you to do that
if you feel unsafe. Because at this point, there’s nothing else we can do."
During a Globe interview over the weekend, Norris, 37, expressed anger over how
he was treated by the RIDE driver.  “It’s a terrible situation,” Norris said
about the incident, which occurred the evening of April 12. “It got to the point
where he stopped communicating with everybody. He just stayed silent.”  And
after finally dropping Norris off hours later in Wakefield, the driver canceled
Norris’s return trip home without telling him, he said.  Norris, who is the vice
president of the Malden Rotary Club, uses a power wheelchair for mobility, he
said. He is also the executive director of [Handi Capable
Fitness](https://www.handicapablefitness.com/), a nonprofit he founded to help
people living with disabilities stay active and healthy.  The T apologized to
Norris for “his troubling experience” and said it has launched an investigation
into what occurred during the RIDE trip, according to a statement released to
the Globe.  Norris confirmed that he was called by an MBTA official Saturday who
apologized for what happened. The call was placed less than an hour after the
Globe contacted the agency for comment.  Full story:

From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):  Phillip Eng starts what is widely
considered to be one of the hardest jobs in Massachusetts state government
Monday: general manger of the MBTA.  Eng’s first commute in his new role started
from Orient Heights on the Blue Line to Government Center, switching to the
Green Line to Park Street Station Monday morning where he took questions from
reporters.  On his ride, Eng said he spoke to riders and T workers. He said he
spoke to an “essential worker” who relied on the T during the pandemic.  “Just
listening to her and her dependence on the system is very inspiring, which is
all the more reason we have a lot of work to do to restore the service to where
it should be and make sure it’s safe,” he said.  Eng takes over the MBTA at a
time of intense frustration for riders who have endured drastic service cuts and
a long series of grave safety incidents over the last 18 months, including a
falling ceiling panel that nearly missed a commuter last month. Eng’s first day
also happens to be the one year anniversary of the dragging death of a Red Line
rider, 39 year old Robinson Lalin, at Broadway Station, which spurred, in part,
a federal safety inspection of the agency last year.  Eng offered his “deepest
sympathies to Robinson Lalin’s family,” calling his death a “tragic incident.”
He said he understands the public’s frustration about continued safety incidents
and reliability problems.  “I’m going to demonstrate that we can turn it
around,” he said. “You’ll start to see meaningful improvements. It’ll be slow at
the beginning. But as you start to see them come, I think people will regain
that trust.”  Since Eng took the job late last month, he said he has been in
discussions with staff about the major issues facing the agency, including
widespread slow zones that still cover 25 percent of subway tracks.

I feel when I have rode the Commuter Rail it is so frustrating that unlike other
rail systems in the world and the US, often during peak hours, they only open
the ADA car towards the front of the train, as well as only 1 door to go in and
out of, and forcing people to have to wait at one end of the platform, instead
of being able to wait anywhere on the platform, and board anywhere. I don't know
why the MBTA and its contractors have a policy of funneling people via one door
into 1-2 cars at the front of the train? Its one reason why there are delays.
And at North and South Station, because of this, you have to walk along the
platform all the way up to the front of the train to the second set of doors to
board. I think on all trains, they need to change it to open most to all the
commuter rail cars, have all the doors power operated, and at the full length
high level platforms, the conductor should remotely open all the doors
(following the example of the MNRR and LIRR in New York).

Yesterday I lost my monthly pass. Obviously my bad. However, MBTA ostensibly has
a system in place for you to recover the value on your card if you are to lose
it. However, you can't just transfer value from card to card online; you have to
report the card as missing then wait for them to mail you a replacement in 3-5
days. Mind you, this is an unlimited pass for the month of July, not a finite
money amount. This is the last week of July; by the time I get the replacement
pass, the month will be over, so that value will be lost anyways.  Ultimately,
I'm most frustrated with myself for losing my card in the first place, but if
the standing policy is that if you lose an unlimited pass, you're f\*cked for
however long it takes to get your replacement (up to a week, or a whole quarter
of the month), then just say that instead of acting like recovering lost value
is some easy thing.

pay over $1800 a year for parking, but it’s a choice I’ve made. But $1800 a year

Hey, r/MBTA. looking for advice for a new commuter.  Quick background: A few
months ago, my car's engine exploded. I have since found an extremely promising
job opportunity in Boston off the Longwood station. I live in Wilmington, so I
would be taking the Commuter Rail from Wilmington to North Station, and then
taking the green line to Longwood.  I'm a country mouse. I lived in Medford for
a few years in my early 20's, but now I'm pushing 30 and more accustomed to the
frustrations of 93 and 495.   Full disclosure: I kind of hate public transit.
There's a lot of people in a small area and sometimes it's awkward af. That
said, I understand it's benefits. It's popularity and success in urban European
countries can't be denied and there are a whole lot of benefits to taking public
transit to Longwood from where I am. And this is a FANTASTIC job opportunity.
I'm here for ANY and all advice and tips for a new transit commuter. What do you
find essential to your commute? What makes it better for you, whether it's
passing the time or your favorite walking shoes or attire to wear. This is an
office job, not super fancy, but some place where you dress professional. How
does one do that and still remain somewhat comfortable for 2-3 hours of
commuting each day?

It started, like all r/mbta legends do, with a cacophonous, angry post.  At
first, we downvoted, we laughed. Then we realized it was happening everywhere —
Downtown Crossing, Park Street, Alewife. The details varied, but the essence
stayed the same: a mysterious commuter lurking just close enough to catch your
tap and slip through behind you like a fare-dodging phantom.  They called him
***The Piggybacker.***  Nobody’s ever seen his face clearly. Some say he wears a
Sox cap pulled low. Others claim he materializes only during signal delays,
emerging from the ether between **“The next ALEWIFE train is now approaching
WITH ALL NEW RED LINE CARS.”** announcements.  One witness swears she felt a
warm gust of Dunkin’-scented air moments before the second gate beeped. Another
reports hearing the faint whisper of *“Thanks, bro.”* Followed by the
*swish-swosh* of his jeans, barely hung on by belt loose around his waist.
Transit Police have issued conflicting statements. One press release called him
“an ongoing concern.” Another from Phil Eng insists “fare evasion is under
control.” Meanwhile, the CharlieCard readers continue to beep twice in the
night, behind the backdrop of  *"Hi, I'm Phil Eng, General Manager of the MBTA.
Riders who don't pay thei fare may receive a warning or a fine. Thank you for
doing your part for keeping the T running for everyone."*  Some believe *The
Piggybacker* is a man. Others think he’s an inner machination of the collective
Boston hivemind — a manifestation of collective commuter rage, born from
20-minute headways and broken escalators.  Rumor has it he now posts among us.
Sometimes a new account appears, defending the act: *“Bruh it’s not that deep…*
\~ u/memeology_69  "*oh my god no one cares*" \~ u/Eastern_Belt_8409
Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe *he* reads these threads too.  So stay sharp,
Boston. Hold your ground when you hear footsteps behind you.   Protect your
CharlieCard.   Don’t hesitate at the gate.  And if you feel someone close enough
to share your personal-space bubble… just remember:  **The Piggybacker rides
free — and he always rides again.**

Title: The (MTA) TrainTime app is what the (MBTA) mTicket app should be

I visited NYC this weekend and took both the LIRR and Metro-North a few times to
get to various things. The ticket/scheduling app for the MTA commuter rails is
TrainTime and the user experience is absolutely stellar.  It includes live train
tracking, schedules, and delay/change alerts, on top of ticket purchasing and QR
code display. I can plug in any two stations and it will not only tell me the
next departure I can take to do that trip, but it will give me a button right on
that screen to buy a ticket for it. No knowledge of zones or line names
required.   Even more impressive (to me at least) is it handles cross-system
connections seamlessly. Just to test it I plugged in a trip from Mets-Willets
Point (on the LIRR in Queens) to Yankees-153rd (on Metro-North in the Bronx). It
immediately came up with an itinerary that had me transferring at Grand Central
(and showed me the "layover" time) and again let me buy a single ticket that
would cover me for the whole trip.  Can we get the same contractor that built
TrainTime to rebuild mTicket for the T? Why do I buy a ticket from SS to
Readville but then have to go lookup the schedule of a few different lines to
find the next departure that's actually going there? Wouldn't it be nice if the
app itself suggested doing a Mansfield to Chelsea trip by getting off at Back
Bay and taking the OL to NS? Why do should I need two tickets just because my
trip takes two physical trains?  I feel like I've seen the future and now I'm
angry I have to go back.

yesterday I waited for about 45 minutes at North Station to catch a Union Square
train but they kept getting taken out of service - both Medford and Union trains
were all stopping at North and dropping everyone off, and the conductors kept
saying another train was coming so we kept waiting. the attendants in the
station didn't say anything was out of the ordinary. eventually I decided to
just get out of the station and wander the north end for like an hour, then went
back to the station where many people were still waiting for a green line. the
attendants then came out and told us to take shuttle buses. we all went upstairs
to wait for shuttles, and they said one would be there in 10 minutes. 25 minutes
later, they had us illegally cross the street in front of TD gardens and wait on
the other side. 3 buses were lined up but not accepting passengers because the
drivers didn't know where they were supposed to be taking us. the driver of the
bus I got on said he works in Lynn and this was supposed to be his day off. the
front 2 buses both went to Medford, and the last one went to Lechmere. I got off
at Lechmere and people were running around like headless chickens there trying
to get where they needed to go because there was no signage and nobody had any
directions. I eventually got a 69 bus to Harvard that was super delayed
apparently and got off along the way because there was no direct way to get to
Union Square - the trains were still down and no shuttles were going that way.
it was a pretty annoying experience. luckily I had nowhere I really needed to be
and it was nice out, but a lot of people were super angry, yelling at attendants
and drivers and other passengers that also didn't know what was going on. does
anyone know what happened on the eastbound green line between like 6:30pm-9pm?

what would be the best way to request clearer signage or ask that not parking in
a bus stop is enforced?   i recently moved and the bus stop i now use always has
cars parked at it. there is only one sign for the bus. the first day i waited to
go to work a giant box truck sat at the end of the stop, and i was afraid the
bus might miss me. thankfully i’ve had the pleasure of very careful drivers that
pay close attention (as is their job) but im afraid i’ll miss the bus one day
(and this bus only runs every hour or so- it is not a key route, but i rely on
it).  even today, standing in the only open section of the bus stop, a car came
over and parked right in front of me. i looked at them and i looked at the sign.
i’m just kind of disappointed, especially considering there is a parking lot
right before it!   is there a good way to contact the mbta about this? or should
i ask the city (somerville)? feel free to also commiserate with me if you have
had a similar situation, or if a bus missed you because the stop was blocked (to
make sure i’m not overreacting). have a great day yall

Hopefully this helps others avoid the mistake over the next two weekends...  I
along with dozens of other riders arrived back to $50 parking tickets this
afternoon in the Whale's Tooth / New Bedford station parking lot. Issued by the
lot owners, not by the City of NB fwiw  We decided to take a trip up to Boston
on a whim today and I made the honest mistake of hurriedly misreading the
['Station Issue' alert
below](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/CR-NewBedford/alerts) this morning, to
confirm that free weekend fares and parkings were indeed extended to June 1:
&gt; Station Issue Ongoing   &gt; On Saturdays and Sundays at 5 of the new Fall
River/New Bedford Line stations, parking will be free through June 1, 2025.
MBTA.com/projects/south-coast-rail  &gt; Free weekend parking through June 1,
2025 at the following station parking lots:  &gt; East Taunton  &gt;
Middleborough  &gt; Freetown  &gt; Church Street  &gt; Fall River Depot   &gt;
Updated: 5/17/2025 2:07 PM EDT  So there is still free weekend parking on 5 of
the 6 station **excluding** the New Bedford station. I misread this, and I'd
wager a guess that the same is true for many of the other riders today.   I
suppose this is because these other 5 stations have MBTA owned lots, while the
Whale's Tooth lot is owned by the New Bedford Port Authority.   But yeah, I was
quite disappointed to come back to this. This was only the second time I had
ridden on the commuter rail, after a positive experience on Patriots' Day. No
first-time warning, and I definitely was not avoiding a $2 weekend parking
cost... I just assumed regular weekend fares / parking fees went into effect on
June 1 along with ALL of the other stations, since the fare itself was still
free.  ---  UPDATE: [New Bedford Port Authority Will Void and Waive Parking

RM transit made a video last year about p3s &amp; what happens with them. It was
a good watch &amp; I wanted to share my takeaways from it.    His 1st talking
point is the Canada line in Vancouver.  It cost less than 2 billion CAD &amp;
opened ahead of schedule.  They standardized stations &amp; driverless trains to
have reliable &amp; frequent service.  The private operator  will operate the
line for a set number of years per their contract. When it ends, the public
transit operator &amp; government takes over. Ive heard 2 conflicting numbers
about the length of the contract. The video says its 30 years, while Wikipedia
says its 35. Just throwing that out there.   His 2nd talking point was line 9 of
the Seoul metro. The private company in that case was at odds with the
government about ticket prices. It seems they've managed to figure that out, but
it could be a problem in the future. The operator essentially wanted to charge a
higher fare for using their line compared to the rest of the system.    Fares
did rise system wide eventually, but  they wanted to add an additional increase.
They were met with threats of fines from the Seoul government after giving the
excuse that the increase was to account for inflation. I'll include a link to a
post about this online, but it just seems really messy.(see
https://www.substack-bahn.net/p/hell-line-lessons-from-seouls-controversial )
The final points I heard were that the private sector can have better innovation
&amp; efficiency if profitability isn't the goal. I dont know how true that
statement is. Right now, keolis has struggled with staffing scr, resulting in
substituting buses for trains &amp; making the commute hours longer than it
should be. I understand the workers have bad pay &amp; long hours &amp;
lackluster benefits.     Im wondering if another company taking over cr would
change that. If that happens, staffing issues might not be as bad as they are
now. I was disappointed today to see the board meeting didn't have any updates
about cr. I still feel like we need more info about how a p3 would be
incorporated in our system. Without that, no one here can make a good judgment
call about how things could pan out. I want to be optimistic about it, but I
also have doubts.

BOSTON, October 17, 2024— TransitMatters is deeply disappointed to learn that
the recent Green Line derailment resulted from excessive speed and operational
negligence. This incident underscores the need for the MBTA to reinforce strict
adherence to safety protocols across all levels of its operations.   We strongly
urge the MBTA to commit to a thorough review of its training and operational
oversight to ensure that all operators follow established safety rules. The
safety of riders and employees alike must remain a top priority, and these
incidents must be prevented at all costs.   While operator negligence appears to
have been a key factor in this derailment, we hope that the MBTA is also
examining the low-speed design of the switch where this event occurred. A design
review could lead to adjustments that accommodate higher operating speeds,
improving efficiency on the line and reducing the risk of future incidents.
Additionally, this derailment highlights the urgent need for the long-overdue
overhaul of the Green Line’s signal system. An upgraded system would likely have
mitigated the overspeed that led to this derailment and could prevent similar
incidents from occurring in the future. Signal modernization must remain a top
priority for the T, which requires sustained financial and operational
commitment.  Lastly, we caution the MBTA against implementing performative or
reactionary "safety measures" that would unnecessarily disrupt service on the
Green Line without addressing core issues. Genuine improvements come from
long-term, sustainable solutions, not quick fixes.   The MBTA’s funding model is
fundamentally flawed. Without a shift toward long-term, stable financing, the T
will continue to face challenges in completing the safety upgrades that are so
clearly needed. We call on our leaders to provide the resources necessary to
keep our transit system safe, reliable, and efficient for all riders.

This past Tuesday afternoon, my brain apparently left my head. I exited from
Kendall Station and boarded Bus #68 (I think? It was headed toward Harvard
according to the sign) and sat near the back door. The driver prompted me for
fare so I made my way forward, Charlie Card in hand with the full intention of
tapping, but asked a stupid question instead. He grumbled out an irritated
answer, so I made a hasty retreat to grab my bag but apparently forgot my book
on the seat next to it.  It's called The Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King.
It's a paperback novel and has a dragon and a castle on the cover. It's a
library book belonging to BPL so while I'd be greatly disappointed that I'd lost
my own personal book, I'd really like to keep my account in good standing with
the library.  I called Lost and Found and the person who answered said no one
has turned in a book. So I'm hoping someone on reddit came across it or knows
someone who did or knows someone who knows someone who will at least return it
to the library for me.

Title: I wrote a letter to your State Rep about Funding The T so you didn’t have to!

Posted: 2024-06-14 12:14:40 UTC

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Representative [Representative's Last Name],  I am writing to you as a
resident of [Your Town or Community], a community significantly reliant on the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) for daily commuting and
economic activity. I am deeply concerned about the potential service cuts to the
MBTA, which threaten not only our ability to commute but also the broader
economic stability and vibrancy of our community outside Boston.  The MBTA’s
Board of Directors recently approved a budget of $3 billion for the fiscal year
2025, which is a commendable effort to maintain the system’s operational
integrity in the short term. However, this budget uses reserve funds to close a
current funding gap, a stopgap measure that is unsustainable in the long run.
With an impending $700 million shortfall anticipated for fiscal year 2026, the
threat of significant service cuts looms large, which would be catastrophic for
constituents like us who depend on these services for our daily lives.  The
persistent underperformance of key revenue sources, such as state sales tax and
fare collections, exacerbates this issue. Sales tax revenue, which is partly
allocated to fund the MBTA, has grown at a disappointing average annual rate of
2.29% over the past two decades, far below the projected 6.46 to 8.50%. This
shortfall has resulted in a cumulative loss ranging from $8.9 to $15.5 billion,
severely limiting the MBTA's financial capacity to invest in necessary
infrastructure improvements and expansions.  Additionally, the change in
commuting patterns post-pandemic and the decrease in the use of monthly passes
have led to fare revenues hovering at only about 60% of pre-pandemic levels.
These factors, combined with necessary but disruptive track replacements and
repairs, have deterred ridership. While there have been initiatives to make
parts of the system fare-free to mitigate these impacts, such measures are not a
long-term solution to the underlying financial instability.  Given these
challenges, I urge you to take a proactive role in advocating for innovative and
sustainable funding solutions that will support the MBTA's operational and
capital needs. It is imperative that the state legislature explore a variety of
funding mechanisms, such as:  1. Adjusting the Formula for State Sales Tax
Allocation - Consider revising the percentage of state sales tax dedicated to
the MBTA to better reflect the current economic realities and the critical
importance of the transit system.     2. Implementing Congestion Pricing -
Introduce congestion pricing for vehicular traffic in high-density areas during
peak times, with revenues earmarked specifically for public transportation
funding.     3. Public-Private Partnerships - Encourage partnerships with
businesses that benefit from a robust public transit system, potentially through
direct investment or tax incentives for contributions to transit funding.  4.
Federal Funding Opportunities - Actively pursue additional federal grants and
funding through newly available infrastructure initiatives, ensuring that
Massachusetts maximizes its receipt of national resources dedicated to public
transportation.  It is crucial that we treat the maintenance and improvement of
the MBTA not just as a fiscal challenge, but as an opportunity to enhance the
quality of life for all Massachusetts residents, foster economic development,
and reduce environmental impact. Our community, and many others like it, rely on
the MBTA for access to jobs, education, healthcare, and more. The prospect of
reduced services could have dire consequences on our day-to-day living and
economic opportunities.  Thank your for your attention to this pressing issue. I
look forward to your support and advocacy for a stronger, more reliable MBTA as
an essential pillar for the prosperity of our entire state.  Sincerely, Your
Name Here

Hi everyone, Matt here from TransitMatters. The MBTA recently released a [draft
Capital Investment
Plan](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-03/2022-03-24-proposed-fy23-27-mbta-cip-2.pdf)
which will guide how they invest in infrastructure and rolling stock over the
next 5 years. Disappointingly, it hardly has anything for commuter rail
electrification and certainly nothing indicating they intend to start any time
soon, which will cost billions in federal funding that's available now. We would
appreciate it if everyone who wants a fast, clean, electrified rail network in
Greater Boston could comment on the draft CIP before comments close April 25 or
attend the next Zoom meeting April 12! Feel free to use this [template
email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCEQ4M2SVYy-jv0zi75FYTh6LaDnlQlMcO5bmP_AEBg/edit)
urging the MBTA to electrify our regional rail system.

It says [here](https://www.mbta.com/projects/fenway-portal-project) that this
work is 62% complete with projected completion in spring of 2020. Typical MBTA
project scheduling. I could understand if work were suspended early in the
pandemic, but I’m somewhat disappointed that this web page hasn’t been updated
with a new projected completion date, given the fact that summer is almost over.
Anyone have any idea what the actual schedule is? Is this complete with the web
site forgotten? Is it still at 62%? If it’s not yet done, is there any estimate
of when it will be? Or is it stuck in perpetual March, waiting for a vaccine?  I
confess, I don’t really care all that much, six months into telecommuting, but I
expect I’ll be taking the train again someday, and I’d like to think there might
be progress on some of these projects.

For those who couldn't make it, here are some notes from the Lynnway meeting
tonight:  **Stated goals:**  * Faster travel times on public transport between
Lynn and Wonderland * Make the Lynnway less dangerous * Build out transit for
ongoing and future redevelopment of the commercial areas * Preserve a major
private vehicle access road to Nahant, Swampscott, and Marblehead  **About the
design:**  * They don't have a plan, they have concepts of a plan. Nothing is
final.  * There will be a minimum of 2 private vehicle travel lanes between the
bridge and Market St * No commitment to center-running bus lanes but at least
some form of bus priority seems very likely, the MBTA's Bus Priority Project
Manager was the presenter after all. * Technically a different project but the
replacement for the General Edwards bridge will feature a bi-directional shared
use path. Continuation of this path along the Lynnway seems overwhelmingly
likely. * The presenter was fairly pessimistic about pedestrian overpasses but
as mentioned, nothing is final.  * Stated preference to avoid eminent domain so
don't a complete overhaul of the entire area.  **General participant
sentiments:**  * Both pro and anti bike/bus lane speakers, some more well stated
than others shall we say * Lots of confusion about the redevelopment plans, and
a lot of people not aware that there is any redevelopment at all * Nahant was
wildly over-represented in speakers. Lynn folks need to come out! Your town,
your politicians and planners, your vote!  **Subjective opinions about the
meeting:**  * There really was not a lot to present, it makes me question the
utility of having the meetings at this stage.  * If these meetings are
happening, the format is absolutely terrible. This should be an open-house,
interactive style event where people can see models and diagrams of what is
being considered for the area. Without that there's just a lot of generic talk
that could be a 2 sentence email. * If the format is going to be this, the
presentation was not very good. Way too much time was spent talking about
abstract goals of safety and equity, not enough time was spent talking about
(and no time was spent *showing*) present and future conditions, and what
impacts that is having on the process.

Do the Blue Line shuttles have to stop at every stop? Would it be so terrible to
split them so they run express to Airport (where you wait 6-8 minutes)?   Would
it be so hard to stand in the commuter’s shoes and plan the service disruptions

This is just an observation I've made watching the SCR rollout, the bill to run
the CapeFLYER full time, and the post about bringing the MBTA up to
Nashua/Manchester/Concord, but it seems like Boston and eastern MA are a lot
more focused on expanding the network to new cities and towns in the periphery
than they are on making sure those expansions are frequent and high-quality.
The SCR rollout got screwed because of the bottleneck on the Old Colony Lines
between Braintree and Andrew, and any CapeFLYER expansion would run straight
into that same bottleneck. Among existing services, Haverhill gets shafted with
90-minute frequencies (and yes, I'm salty about it because I commute
reverse-peak from Boston to Lawrence), and most lines run every 35 minutes or
worse reverse peak and every two hours on weekends. The system works somewhat
decently for the 9-5 commuter market, but isn't terribly useful outside of that
unless you get *very* lucky.  My personal opinion is that we should probably
place a moratorium on new expansions further out into the periphery until we've
done the work to build a system core that can reliably handle 15-minute peak and
20-30 minute off-peak service on each branch, and what I'm proposing below is
what I think a realistic path to getting there looks like:  1. Rebuild the Old
Colony lines between Andrew and Braintree to double-track, with a triple-track
overtake from Savin Hill to JFK-UMass. Make room for the northern half of this
by moving the Red Line branch point from Andrew to the location where the
Ashmont branch turns right toward Fields Corner. For the southern half of this
you need to widen the ROW probably by 5-7 feet. 2. Add passing sidings to the
Greenbush, Plymouth, and outer Haverhill lines with an eye toward full
double-tracking of those lines, and double track the entire Middleboro-Lakeville
Line 3. Add quad-track overtakes on the NEC near Mansfield and Hyde Park, and on
the Worcester line at Framingham, near Wellesley Hills, and near Westborough 4.
Fully double-track the outer Franklin Line, SCR Phase II, the outer Newburyport
and outer Rockport Lines, and the entire Haverhill Line, rebuild Waltham as a
triple-track elevated station, and double-track the Wildcat Branch 5. Electrify
the core of the network (out to Beverly, Reading, Lowell, Concord, Framingham,
Walpole, and Brockton), build pocket tracks at those locations, and build a
quad-track NSRL. Buy a set of Stadler FLIRTs or KISSes and start through-running
electric trains on the core network 6. Double-track the Needham Line to Needham
Junction and hand that over to the Orange Line 7. Rebuild key junctions (Reading
Junction near Sullivan Sq, the Wildcat junctions in Wilmington, Canton Junction,
the junctions near Braintree) as flyovers so that diverging trains don't foul
the mainline. 8. Extend electrification across the entire network, and start
through-running all commuter rail service except a small number of rush-hour
specials. 9. Quad-track the entire NEC down to Providence and add a new
two-track high-speed ROW from East Junction to Providence via Rumford. 10. Add
triple- or quad-track overtakes on the Middleboro-Lakeville line near Brockton
and Bridgewater, on the Haverhill Line near Lawrence and Reading, on the Lowell
Line near Anderson RTC and South Lowell, on the Fitchburg Line at Concord and
Ayer, and on the Newburyport Line at Newburyport and Chelsea 11. Add full-time
CapeFLYER service year-round, expand Downeaster service, and run East-West Rail
to Springfield via Worcester and North Adams via Greenfield. 12. Extend Lowell
Line express trains to Manchester and Concord, re-extend the Greenbush Line to
Plymouth on the old alignment to Marshfield, extend Newburyport trains up to
Portsmouth  Basically, Step 1 fixes the single nastiest bottleneck on the whole
system by freeing up the Old Colony Lines to run at up to 15-20tph combined
north of Braintree, and then Step 2 starts working on strategically adding
double track in places that allow for higher frequencies. Step 3 makes it easier
to boost frequencies on lines that we expect to be shared between local and
express service (whether the express service is MBTA or Amtrak), and Step 4
allows branch frequencies to only be limited by track space in the core.  Step 5
gets you high frequencies in the inner core of the network; pairing a
half-hourly diesel or dual-mode train from North or South station out to the
edges of the network with a half-hourly electric train that runs from one edge
of the core to the other gets you 15-minute service in the core and frees up
tracks in the stub end bits of North and South Station.  Steps 6 and 7 are about
strategic decongestion near the core as frequencies increase; by taking flat
junctions and making them flyovers you make it much easier to route large
numbers of trains through the core without having to wait for junctions to
clear.  Step 8 gets us our climate goals, and lets us get rid of our old diesel
fleet for lighter, faster electric trains across the main network.  Steps 9 and
10 are less about the current commuter rail and more about building the
necessary infrastructure for MA to have a coherent state rail system centered
around Boston. A quad-track NEC and frequent triple- and quad-track overtakes on
the lines that would carry expresses from outside greater Boston (Newburyport,
Haverhill, Lowell, Fitchburg, and Middleboro-Lakeville) make it much easier to
slot current longer-distance express services like the Downeaster, the Lake
Shore Limited (as well as proposed long-distance expresses like trains to
Hyannis, Springfield, North Adams/Greenfield, Manchester/Concord, and
Portsmouth) in amongst the frequent commuter traffic without delays and
bottlenecks, but at *much* lower cost than fully quad-tracking all the corridors
that might carry longer-distance trains.  Finally, Steps 11 and 12 are the
payoff for Western MA, southern NH, and the south shore; having gotten the core
of the network properly built out and having pulled most if not all of the
commuter trains out of the terminating platforms at North and South Station we
*now* have room to start adding new services from outlying cities and towns into
Boston.  What do y'all think?

Ridership and frequency for the 55 is so terrible since post pandemic. It's
horrible and I feel the mbta should add an additional bus line to accommodate
the 50 minutes scheduling that they're going to incorporate with the 55 in a
year or two.  For seniors and those like myself who are disabled and depend on
transit to navigate the city and communities, that one route with it's shitty
scheduling is absolutely horrendous and should be just turned into a shuttle
service to be honest.  I mean it goes to freaking Copley and back to Fenway, why
bother gaining funds for such a shortly ran route?  I'd rather pay to go a
further distance beyond just Copley or Arlington station where it goes right now
in the new scheduling, than just to the library tbh.

Good morning!   Apologies if this is a well-known issue, it's new to me and I
tried to look through the subreddit. I learned this morning on my commute that
the East Boston MBTA ferry no longer accepts the green LinkPass card my employer
provides me.      It's a huge bummer! I love riding my bike to work, but living
in Eastie the only feasible way to get my bike over to the "mainland" during
rush hour is the ferry. I moved here in September and only got to use my bike
for a short while (after settling in) before the ferry "season" ended. I've been
looking forward to April since then when I could ride again, and have been doing
so despite the terrible weather -- only to learn this morning that the pass
(which I've already paid for!) is no longer accepted.      So the only way to
ride the ferry is to pay again for another pass? Dagnabit.      Any ideas or
solutions for this? The LinkPass is awesome for all other transit in my
experience - but this one, unique, neat aspect of public transit in a port city
that allows me to get some exercise and blow off some steam is no longer :(
Edit: I called it a LinkPass when I meant to say it's the green [Perq for
employees card](https://www.mbta.com/pass-program/perq/perq-employees) which I
still pay monthly for.

Is there any feasibility to a red line branch that diverts after Central and
follows Mass Ave all the way down to JFK/Umass? Would be similar I'd imagine to
how the Northern Line operates on the London Underground. Could have 5 new
stops: Newmarket (South Bay), Tremont Street, Mass Ave/Symphony (connecting with
both Orange and E Line), Hynes (connecting with B/C/D Lines), and a new MIT
station on the western side of campus. When thinking about ways to alleviate
pressure on the downtown core, and offer connections to other lines that don't
require going all the way into downtown, this doesn't seem like a terrible
option.   There's obviously plenty of likely barriers to the project, but are
there any right off the bat that would make this a non-starter?

Moved to Boston 2 years ago (Have lived in NY, DC, and Japan among others,
prior) and I’ve really tried to give the red line the benefit of the doubt.
But it feels like a public transport failure relative to other major cities.
Disregarding the shut downs last year which made a 45 min commute a 1.5 hour
commute thanks to busses, the things I’ve noticed as of late are:  1. One of the
“up” escalators at Porter being down for several weeks, haven’t seen anyone
actively working to fix it.  2. Train times completely misaligned with the
posted schedule (google maps is useless - you don’t know until you get to the
station). 3. Extended stops/delays either at or between 50% of stations.  I
basically need to factor in an extra 20-25 minutes into my morning commute to
account for “how the red line is feeling” on a given day.    This is not normal
in other cities. Is this normal in Boston, or is it just the red line? I’m not
hating on MBTA as a whole, I’m just curious if there is one particular
bureaucrat in charge of the red line who sucks at their job, or if it’s a more
systemic issue.   Update: 1 day after posting - the STAIRS next to the broken
escalator at Porter were shut down this evening and commuters were redirected to
exit via the commuter rail stairway. I think the Red Line Czar saw this post
yesterday and is just fucking with me at this point lol.

I was looking around the map at some of the transit options in boston and the
silver line looks like it could be a great service if busses weren’t trapped in
rush our street traffic.   Forgive me for the terrible drawing, i made this on
my phone in north station waiting for a delayed Amtrak (are we surprised? no).
Red is the route I would like the bus to take and the scribbled blue would be
the discontinued original route.  There’s an existing highway entrance ramp that
could cut the trip down by almost a mile in the Outbound direction. In addition
a single new bus only highway exit could be installed to allow busses to exit
the Ted Williams immediately instead of completing the loop all the way back to
silver line way.   The only issue I can see this causing would be skipping the
Silver line way stop in the Inbound direction. I feel that is a reasonable trade
off for reducing the route over 1.5mi.

As a regular red line rider, I am super grateful for the incredible track
improvements accomplished in the last year. However, I've also noticed that the
operations control center has gotten worse at managing dispatching at Alewife
during the last month or so, causing a lot of northbound trains from Davis to
Alewife to stop for a couple of minutes, sometimes more than 5. As the data from
TransitMatters shows, it didn't use to be that bad. I hope that once the track
improvement program wraps up, Eng can focus part of his attention on the
operations control center...

EDIT: Chemical suggests that the increase in the average train speed following
the reopening of the Braintree branch causes the trains to back up at the
termini, since the schedule has not changed accordingly (the scheduled
frequencies have not decreased as much as the average speed has increased). This
sounds like a very sensible reason, and begs the question of why is the MBTA
waiting so long to fine tune the schedule…

and one driver in particular is just awful. He doesn't pull up to the curb or
lower the bus. I almost fell getting on. He sees a red light or stop sign and
speeds the bus up to every single one and completely slams on the brakes every
single time. He routinely forgets to see if any passengers are on the bus.
Doesn't wait for people to depart and closes doors on them. He pulls up to
vehicles and beeps his horn then pulls up neaere and nearer to them if they're
not moving and beeps his horn repeatedly. I'm not sure how people are getting
hired or keeping their jobs transporting the public if this is how they choose
to drive others around. I know it's public transportation but at the very least
id like to feel like I'm getting home safely.

I recently took a daytrip to Rockport on the train. If you haven’t been, it’s a
classic New England seaside town, as the photos show, and everything is walkable
from the Rockport train station. I noticed that the crowd there was very diverse
- in age, race, etc. - which I account to the ease of getting there by train.
Rockport is just one of a few awesome day/weekend trip locations on the T system
- Salem, Providence, Gloucester, etc.   The T’s weekend frequencies are pretty
terrible (about a train every 2 hours to Providence). A simple small step would
be start calling it Regional Rail instead of commuter rail. People use the T for
all kinds of trips, including for leisure, and the T should adapt (and improve
night, weekend service).

Hypothetically... If my girlfriend and I took the MBTA Ferry from Long Wharf to
Charlestown Navy Yard on a Saturday in October... How crowded might it get?   I
would like to ask her a special question while on one knee, and I want to make
sure we would at least have some breathing room on board to do so. Also, is
there an exposed deck? (Definitely wouldn't want to do it inside).   Could very
well be terrible idea but it's the best I've got so far! For background - I have
not rode on the ferry yet but will do a test run soon.

I stumbled on a presentation from the Rail and transit working group for the I90
realignment project and it says “preferred alternative for the Allston
multimodal project will sever the grand junction” it then details how that means
100 miles of detour to get to maintenance yards for south side trains and how it
is simply not feasible. It ends with saying: • The closure of the Grand Junction
will accelerate the need for layover capacity on the south-side of the MBTA's
system • To accommodate the closure, the MBTA will need to build maintenance
facilities on top of existing layover space, which requires replacement layover
elsewhere. • With loss of access to BET, many of these facilities need to be
geared towards the needs of the MBTA's current diesel fleet, instead of future
fleet electrification • Most replacement layover space - and all maintenance
facilities - will need to be complete before the closure of the Grand Junction
to ensure continuity of service • Regional rail electrification projects will be
delayed by use of financial resources and real estate on these diesel projects
This seems all around terrible and the presentation simply delivers it as a
fact.

So this is the Lynn MBTA parking garage as of Friday. I believe the garage is
technically open - it’s not fenced off - but it’s terrifying. I mean there’s
deferred maintenance and then there’s what I imagine buildings look like 5 years
after the start of the zombie apocalypse. The Lynn parking garage is definitely
closer to the latter category. I peaked in to the first level during daylight
hours. It was almost completely dark except I could see a few very
sketchy-looking people wandering around and it absolutely reeked of pee. I mean
I’m a pretty intrepid guy and I wouldn’t step foot in there.   I checked the
MBTA site and apparently a contract was issued for the “deconstruction” of the
garage in 2022. There was also some press about the garage being demolished in
2023. Obviously these things have not occurred and I think the structure has
reached a point where it’s dangerous. Some areas of the station were fenced off
but there was no sign of any active construction activity when I visited on
Friday.   The T owns a lot of real estate in Central Lynn and it comes across as
a terrible slumlord. Does anybody know what’s happening here? Is there a plan?

I didn't see this shared here:      Public transportation is on the verge of an
“existential crisis,” cities and towns that help fund the system warned, as the
MBTA moves ahead with a budget plan that drains its reserves in the face of a
looming deficit.    A T subcommittee voted Thursday to advance a $3.02 billion
fiscal year 2025 budget that would effectively empty the MBTA’s savings to help
drive up spending by 11 percent, leaving no bulwark against a nearly $700
million gap forecast to hit in the following year.    Shortly afterward, the
MBTA Advisory Board — an independent watchdog that represents the 176 cities and
towns served by the T — published an analysis of the spending plan with a stark
warning about what’s on the horizon.    “The riding public, cities and towns,
and all stakeholders face terrible options if the MBTA’s $696 million deficit is
not closed in the next 13 months,” the organization wrote. “This comes at a time
when MBTA ridership has not returned, and analysis suggests that it is unlikely
to return anytime soon given both a flattening of growth versus general
expectations for recovery. The fear is that no action will take place, and
service cuts will be the only available solution if the Authority is forced to
solve its deficits internally.”

This is something I think many of us are thinking about as the new fare system
is planning to be launched this year.  WBZ did a report on fare evaders,
catching 6 people within a short period of time bypassing at Back Bay.   This is
something that is a major issue across the system. I have seen tons of people
try to evade the fares by using a jacket or backpack and waving it behind the
sensor, quickly passing someone who is paying through the gate, or simply
getting onto the train without paying.  This is especially bad at certain
universities such as Boston University and Northeastern where I see tens of
students getting on without paying.   While I understand that some may not want
to pay because of the terrible service, the MBTA do rely on fares as a part of
paying off their debts and developing new projects.   The MBTA need to do more
to prevent fare evaders (unless the person genuinely cannot afford the fare,
homeless, etc).

Title: This is why the Governor and Legislature desperately need to find a permanent, large funding increase for the MBTA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taken from the Audit &amp; Finance Subcommittee March 14, 2024 meeting. The T
has only been holding on the last couple of years by tapping rainy day funds.
And those are completely gone now. Increased expenses come largely from the
increased hiring (ie: actually staffing the system so they can run enough buses
and trains). The fiscal cliff of &gt;$600M shortfall in 2026 would be absolutely
catastrophic. The governor's taskforce **needs** to find a solution for this,
and the legislature **must** follow through on their proposals. No amount of
belt tightening, fiscal responsibility, or accountability is going to magically
make this $600-800 million budget gap go away. Only increased revenue can do
that.  I think it's important to understand the magnitude of the various factors
that contribute to the terrible financial situation, so speaking of revenue: the
T makes about [$450
million](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/2024-01-03-audited-financial-statement-fy2023.pdf)
(pdf download) from fares and other operating revenues. So, chasing increased
fares is not a solution in the short term. Even if ridership doubled overnight,
there would still be about $200 million in budget shortfall in 2026.   On the
other hand, the T spent $786 million on debt repayment over the last year. Which
**IS** enough to make up the budget gap if the debt were eliminated (eg:
absorbed into the State's general fund).   **TLDR**: the T will need about $650
million in additional revenue starting in 2026. This is the result of short term
funding assistance running out and increased expenses due to the T finally
increasing hiring of bus drivers and train operators. The T is holding their
breath for the Governor's task force to find a solution.  &amp;#x200B;

Historically the FVMs have not correctly reacted when a debit card is presented
but the user selects credit. In this case, the FVMs should process the
transaction as a credit purchase and not request a PIN. This was a known
problem, see here:
https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2021/11/15/mbta-new-fare-vending-machine-credit-card/
— the relevant paragraph reads:  “Officials say that if a debit card is used,
but a customer chooses the “credit” option, rather than treating the card like a
credit card as most systems do, the machine will go on to ask for a PIN number,
but the transaction will be denied. The MBTA is working with their vendor to
address the issue, the agency said.”  For awhile this problem was corrected.
However, in recent months this problem has reappeared. To repeat, the problem is
that when a debit card is used but the user selects credit, the FVMs must not
ask for a PIN and instead should process the transaction as a credit transaction
with no PIN. **This is important because some tax-advantaged transit debit cards
have terrible PIN systems.**  Does anyone have any insight as to what the deal
is? I assume the machines get fixed and then they auto-“update” themselves or
something, thus breaking them again?

My experiences with the LA Metro/Chicago L are a constant feeling of being on
edge, and there were a lot of drugged out individuals on both systems. The LA
Metro is legit open air drug use and a homeless hotel, and it does not feel
remotely safe.  The L is slightly better , but have witnessed fights break out
on it and on platforms, with nobody doing anything to stop it, it is a step up
from LA Metro only because there seems to be normal commuters on it.  MARTA , I
feel has some of the same issues as the L, but slightly less so, and my
experience is dated, having not taken it since 2018.   DC Metro, same dated
experience since 2018, some edginess on it , but overall feels safe, and the
main issue is the terrible headways.  I like the NYC Subway, great headways,
24/7, but I won't deny since COVID, there has been an uptick of homeless
/violence on the trains, still years better than the L .  The T is the one
system I have never felt on edge, and something will happen to me. Yes, there
are occasional issues, but overall, for me it has always felt safer than other
systems. My worst experiences over 20 years of riding the T is weird dude
blasting music and throwing  his trash in a international students backpack on
the Orange Line, and some occasional non violent homeless having a mental

So, I was in Lowell and I wanted to go see my friend near Savin Hill, with
parking being a pain and the drive taking an hour , I wanted to just take the
commuter rail, green line, red line which woul take 1:15, so not terribly more
but with more comfort.   The problem is the price. 11 dollars one way from
Lowell, and then 2.70 on the subway. I have no problem with the 2.70 fare but
there's no need for it to cost so much for me to get from Lowell , when it
literally is cheaper for me to drive.  At the end of the day, people look for
quality , comfort , and price. The price of driving is cheaper than taking the
train, the comfort is more on the train, but the quality bc you may have to wait
a while for a train is also its downfall. Overall, taking a car wins.  Also,so
many people take busses to places like Lynn , Belmont, Waltham , Newton and its
a 7.00 fare which is more expensive than bus plus subway. Why is the price not
lowered to 3.00 within Zones 1 and 2 to encourage people to take the train
instead of the bus, as well as people that would normally drive.    Increase it
50 cents per zone, so Lowell would be a 5.00 ride instead of 11.00 and Worcester
would be a 6.00 ride instead of 12.00  .  With prices this low, there would be
more packed trains bc fewer would choose the car,  and would be great for the
environment , and if more people take the train, politicians will fund the MBTA
more.  Opinions:

need to extend as Milton is pretty sparce NO NEED TO EXTEND  NORTH:  Common
logic is to extend it through Arlington and Lexington and end it where the
Lexington Compost Facility is near Hanscom Air Force Base  I think this is a
TERRIBLE IDEA. Outside of East Arlington, the rest of Arlington is very
suburban, and Lexington is the THIRD WEALTHIEST TOWN in the state, right behind
Weston and Wellesley, no need to extend it miles through a rich suburb, where
people will oppose building multi family zoning and the T will go to waste.
INSTEAD, have it head south through Belmont with stops at Belmont , Waverley
(just as dense as East Arlington), Warrendale , Waltham, and Brandeis. Much
denser area and more logical. Build up Waltham and it will prolly be more
supported there.

Can anybody tell me if they've heard ANYTHING about increasing service on
Commuter Rail lines specifically?  The available train times are so misaligned
from my work schedule that soon I'm going to have to begin using PTO just to get
home before 1am, and on weekends I'm going to have to just wander around outside
for the two hours between the end of my shift and the next available train.  Not
to mention, waking up at 5:45 just to make it to the start of my shift at 9am.
My commute has never been perfect - I'm almost always an hour early, but the
trips home are just...terrible.    I'm so exhausted - I wouldn't have taken this
job if the commute was this bad when I started, but because the job market is so
messed up right now - I can't leave it and find something closer to home.  I'm
just left praying that the commuter rail service will expand soon.

[transport library at 10 Park

or tossed (according to folks working there who I spoke to as they were getting

And why am I not hearing more outrage? Seems like it's a typical winter. It's no
news that Boston is not Florida.  It's not just the delays, but also the
terrible treatment of customers. On three occasions no alerts were sent out
about train cancelations until 5 minutes before, or even AFTER the train's
arrival time!

Ppl are packed in North Station like sardines today, the Orange Line partially
shut down doesn’t help with this congestion, the transit ambassadors telling us
to ride green line to Copley and that’s where the Orange Line shuttle buses are
to Forest Hills. They should have shuttle buses from the Orange Line run to
North Station because this congestion is ridiculous. I couldn’t even get on the
first 5 green line trains that came because it was far too congested

I've seen people complain about the smell of North Station, but nothing compares
to Courthouse from my experience.  This station uniquely always has a rancid
smell like that of vomit. It's horrible and I'm wondering if anyone has any
guesses why it does. I know there's issues to do with water leaking in the
station, maybe it has something to do with that?

Title: What do people think about the free weekends? NB/FR Line

Been riding during the free weekends on the new Bedford/Fall river and the
information being given is sorta all over the place/poorly or even rudely given
at times about it being free or paid or other communication from crew.  The
previous holiday weekend we had pretty good crews, Saturday they gave train
number, stops and explained what stops were free and weren't, on holiday Monday
because our train left over 30 minutes late didn't care about collecting fares,
thought no one in South station provided information other than it was delayed.
This past weekend it was very mixed we had an okayish crew going in, they didn't
collect fares either past the new stations either. On the way back we got an
extremely awful crew that seemed to know nothing and didn't care to inform
anyone property instead saying over the intercom to active tickets and not
saying anything about the free stops, on top of that they seemed to not
understand that the redline wasn't running and was free too because the
conductor instead wanted to get into a fight when we spoke up because she wanted
to charge someone getting off at braintree when it was free due to no service
and then wanted to give us sas when I tried to explained how the previous
weekend another conductor explained it over the intercom and that's a bit more
informative and less vague than doing it in person. Instead she just got annoyed
and said that's them and again tried to sas me about what stops were free or not
(even after not knowing and seemingly charging people for the redline shutdown
stops)  My only real reason for saying anything at all was that I feel like the
crews should do a better job explaining this (still pretty funny she didn't even
know about the redline shutdown) because alot of riders I seen are new ones and
just saying "activate your tickets" makes them second guess if the service is
actually free and could accidentally cause people to buy tickets when they
didn't need to.  And maybe I'm not the only person but I feel like the MBTA
should just offer some kind of free service for all of the Middleborough line
because yeah the new stops are new but it has caused people who always took the
train immense issues the last few weekends that originally didn't have issues
yet they still getting charged while they fix the mess keolis caused.  The rest
of May is free so we'll see how the crews respond onwards, I already read an
article about one of the local senators asking for answers and saying that we
should get free service whenever service is fully recovered (tho crossing my
fingers the last weekend was fine I guess we'll see if that continues I think
keolis is scared after that 51k fine)  I'm curious if anyone else have
encountered this on there trips or not, I always personally joked about how the
T talks about losing money via fares but the commuter rail on weekends seems
like the least amount of collection is done but I feel like conductors should
atleast know when not and when to charge and to explain it to the people onboard
in a manner that doesn't lead to mistakingly purchases.

Title: MyCharlie website &amp; support team both awful - why do they mail you a new card without warning?

Author: LordPancreas (ID: t2_343j6)
Posted: 2024-09-11 19:45:44 UTC
Post ID: 1fej90v

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I get pre-tax commuter benefits through work, so I had Auto-pay set up on my
CharlieCard to get the $90 LinkPass every month, starting late August for
September use.  Well, it charged my benefits card the $90, but whenever I
scanned my CharlieCard at the turnstile (using the older contact pads), the
screen would report “Not enough value“. Uh… what?  **The way I thought it
worked:** You type in the serial number of your *existing* pass on the website,
your credit card is charged, and the value on the pass is updated automatically.
I’ve used this website to refill the value of my card remotely in the past, and
I never expected them to retire this functionality.  **The way it actually
works:** When you set up Auto-pay for the first time, they MAIL YOU A WHOLE NEW
CARD. This is apparently covered in the
[FAQ](https://www.mbta.com/fares/auto-pay/about-auto-pay), which I wouldn’t
think to check beforehand:
https://preview.redd.it/fudxplmyc8od1.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e137f29ea1a8bca0ed2bf927f273da0ac35d3fac
However:  1. The fact that you are getting a new card is mentioned NOWHERE on
the website before or after setting up Auto-pay 2. They do not e-mail you to
tell you a new card is on the way 3. To the best of my knowledge, no mail has
come in containing the new card with my September LinkPass value on it. Even if
it were to arrive soon, we are almost halfway through September and in the
meantime I have been buying individual fares on top of the $90 I already spent.
Not knowing anything about this process, I was surprised to see on my MyCharlie
dashboard that there were now two cards… at the time I thought OK, well this is
clearly a mistake; the Auto-pay value should have gone onto the card I actually
have in my possession, not this mysterious ghost-card that doesn’t exist.  So I
called customer service (1-888-844-0355), and I get this guy who just sounds
annoyed that he even has to pick up the phone at all. I explain that I have
Auto-pay set up but my card isn't working. After making me hold to bring up my
information he just goes “OK we'll send you a new card in 3–5 business days” or
whatever. Meanwhile I'm like uh… but I already have a card?? I was assuming he
would actually try to get to the bottom of my specific problem. He immediately
starts talking to me like a moron; his voice dripping with condescension. “Yes,
but you said the card doesn’t work… So we’re sending you a new one…”  In
hindsight, I can see where the disconnect was: He thought I was saying my
existing *Auto-pay card* (which I did not know was a separate thing, and which I
don’t actually have) wasn’t working. In reality, I was saying that my existing
*CharlieCard* wasn’t working, which is apparently *expected behavior*.  But he
made no effort to clarify what I meant.  I was like, “OK but how do I know the
same thing won't happen?”  “Well, you’ll just have to try the new card.”  I
intervene with “Hold on, I’m looking at my dashboard—just seeing this for the
first time that I have two cards on there?”  “Sir, you can only set up Auto-pay
with one card.”  “Yeah but I didn’t add the second card…”  And the guy just gets
annoyed and tries explaining slowly that they just have to replace the card, as
if I am being totally unreasonable. His tone is so enraging that I just hang up
on him, which I normally would never do. I just had so little patience for his
default impatience.  So yeah, just a shitty product and a shitty customer
service to top it all off. There has been NO communication on this change, or
even WHY it’s necessary from a technical standpoint. If it was true that you
could load value to a CharlieCard remotely in the past, why is that no longer
the case? If you can process an individual transaction at random intervals, you
can surely process individual transactions at fixed intervals. It makes no
goddamn sense. I can only surmise that they are pretending that Auto-pay has
some unique quality to it as an excuse to upgrade the security of the passes,
because the older ones have some kind of flaw in them (I recall the MIT students
who were able to hack them; I don’t know if that was ever resolved).  In short,
they are in serious need of User Interface or User Experience experts on the
team. This is leagues below the baseline usability standards of any modern
web-based application. Additionally, they are in need of more empathetic and/or
technically proficient support personnel. I understand that they are probably
inundated with trivial or nonsensical requests, but I called in over a simple
misunderstanding and was treated like dirt.  This experience has left such a bad
taste in my mouth that I ended up canceling my Auto-pay subscription and will
probably end up canceling my commuter benefits at work as well. There is no way
I come anywhere close to taking $90 worth of T rides in a month in the first
place; I would be better off just doing the individual debit charges using the
OMNY-style terminals. I was just doing the LinkPass for “convenience” (lol) and
to throw a bone to this underfunded organization. But oh well!

We are bringing the kids to this Saturday’s Revs game, and we’re hoping to avoid

suggest I can take the CR to Foxboro:
https://www.mbta.com/destinations/gillette-stadium  But when you check the
schedule there is NO regular Saturday service to Foxboro. It appears that only
specific Revs games are worth setting up special trains.   What’s up with this??
I can imagine it might be perceived as a money loser if there aren’t enough
people attending, but this is likely a Field of Dreams, If you build it they
will come scenario. I know my family would absolutely attend more games if we
didn’t have to face that drive (or parking lot exit).   Or I guess I can hold my

The other day I got offered a job in engineering with the MBTA in their Cabot
Yard complex - I'm pretty keen on it, and frankly even more keen to leave my
current job, but I've got a few questions about it and it seems the
HR/recruitment folks I sent them back to have immediately gone radio silent
which is a problem since my response is due Friday.  I was wondering if anyone
who works for the MBTA, ideally in engineering, might be able to share their
info on the few questions I had:  - What are the standard working hours?  - It
appears their policy has it that employees get zero time off - sick, PTO,
vacation, or otherwise - until a full service year in. That's... pretty awful,
for engineering. Was I misreading that in the benefits page?  - Do they take
counter-offers regarding compensation and benefits? I found their offer had fine
pay, but at this point in my career, starting from literal zero on PTO is pretty
much unheard of, but I'm concerned since it's a union job that there will be no
flexibility on that.  - The job is specified as essential and 24/7. Obviously,
working 24/7 is physically impossible, but in your experience, how often are
folks called in for that sort of work? And how is that overtime work
compensated?  Thanks for any insight any of y'all have!

MBTA commuter rail runs every hour on weekdays on my line (Needham) both ways
for both normal and reverse commuter, and has a non awful weekend schedule. Now
is the schedule perfect? No, I'd like to see every 30 minutes on weekdays, but I
just found out that the DC metro area commuter rail systems (VRE and MARC) only
has ONE of it's lines operating on weekends, with limited reverse commute and
non-traditional timing trips. If the MBTA operated on that schedule, I would not
be able to take the commuter rail for the trips I take it on currently.

Do any basic research and you quickly find that Mass already has an education
system that's the envy of nearly every other state. It consistently ranks in the
top 5 among states.  Contrast that with the awful state of our public transit
system, namely the T, which by virtually every measure has become the laughing
stock of US transit systems. All the while car commutes have taken over, as
people try to avoid the T at all cost, clogging highways with seemingly endless
traffic.   And yet of the $1.3b in new revenue generated from the "millionaires
tax" only $200m gets partitioned off for the T???  Many voters who supported the
millionaires tax were lead to believe that the bulk of that new revenue would
specifically be targeted to improve the T.  Wtf happened???  This is why people
have little faith in supporting new taxes.

So, I  leave work at about 10:45 on weekends. Semi-recently (maybe late
September), and seemingly at random and not from the shift to the fall schedule,
the 78 (which is the bus that stops closest to my house, by a lot) was shifted
25 minutes earlier from 11:35 to 11:10.   This wouldn't be an issue, except the
1 bus that is supposed to arrive at the stop close to my work at 10:45 has been
*repeatedly* cancelled at the last minute. If I get on the 1 bus at 11, there's
no way I make it from the Back Bay to Harvard in time. This means I have to wait
upwards of 25 minutes for a 77, which is often 10 minutes late for no readily
apparent reason, and also takes longer and drops me an extra 10-15 minute walk
from my house.   This turns what is normally a 35-40 minute commute into a
nearly 90 minute one. Especially awful because one of those days is a double
shift.

Good evening, my lovely T riders. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday
weekend. Just thought I’d share my experience out on the line today, since we
didn’t get our usual slow zone update.   Disclaimer: The information in this
post is sourced purely from my anecdotal experience as a Red Line Motorperson
(driver). We’ll see what the actual numbers look like when they come out,
probably tomorrow  **Southbound, Main Line:** * Still 10mph all the way from
Alewife to Porter * 10mph about 1/3 of the way from Charles MGH to Park Street,
and continuing all the way through DTX and part of the way to South Station *
10mph from Broadway all the way through Andrew and to JFK. Absolutely grueling.
**Southbound, Braintree Line:** * LARGE new 10mph slow zone between JFK and
North Quincy. They put down a TON of new ballast in this area over the weekend
though, so this slow zone *should* be lifted within the coming weeks as the new
ballast settles * Possibly a few new 25mph zones, but I don’t notice those
nearly as much as the god-awful 10mph restrictions  **Northbound, Braintree
Line** * Large stretch of 10mph restriction between Braintree and Quincy Adams.
There is new ballast here too, so this should be lifted in the coming weeks as
it settles. * North Quincy to JFK has been improved significantly. It is now a
40mph zone over about 1/2 of that stretch, which feels massively better
considering the distance between those stops. There are a few areas with new
ballast and a 25mph restriction. However, it does still drop down to 10mph
approaching the Devaughn flyover, through JFK and to the 12-1 signal, where is
picks back up to 25mph * From Andrew to Broadway, it is 25mph halfway until it
drops to 10mph  **Ashmont Line, North and South** * This entire line is still
basically one massive slow zone. Absolutely horrendous. I feel deeply for anyone
who uses this line for their daily commute. Driving it sucks but at least I’m
being paid for my misery. Hopefully it will be improved in the weeks-months
after the upcoming shutdown.   **Conclusion** I can say with confidence that
going Northbound, especially from Braintree, there are many fewer 10mph
restrictions and many more 40mph zones than in the same areas going Southbound.
**TL;DR** If you only take the Red Line going Southbound, it’s not all that bad
🤡  Thanks for reading. Happy to answer any non-identifying questions in the
comments

From my perspective, the biggest issue with the layout of the T is it’s a
classic hub and spoke system. Getting from say one end of the Red Line to one
end of the Green Line is awful because you have to go through Park Street. We
need a line that cuts across the others.   To that end, why not a new train line
along Bus Route 1 plus Newmarket and JFK/UMass i.e., Central Square to Hynes to
Symphony to Mass Ave (Orange Line) to Mass Ave (Silver Line) to Newmarket to
JFK/UMass? It would decrease the distance and stops along all these lines;
problems at Park Street or Downtown Crossing would not upend the entire system;
it would provide another connection between the Red Line and the Commuter Rail;
and it would avoid having to deal with the Green Line stations that are
at-grade. Additionally, more stops could be added at MIT or along Mass Ave to
increase access, and it could be extended beyond Central to the Northern sides
of the Green and Orange Lines.  Is such a line possible? If so, would that not
give us the most bang for our buck possible?  Edit: this would be a heavy rail.
Sorry for not stating that

Last night both times I took the Red Line in Cambridge I heard an awful,
physically painful squealing sound. It occurred in several sections between
Alewife and Davis, between Davis and Poter, and between Harvard and Central. It
was distinct from the "usual" squealing, and at least twice as loud as the
Harvard curve squeal. A good half of the train car winced in pain and attempted
to muffle the sound with their hands, to no effect.   I really hope this is a
temporary thing because it's definitely in the "damaging to hearing" territory.

Can anyone explain to me why the Green Line squeals like the hounds of hell
having an altercation with a flock of flying pigs?   For a long time, I thought
it was because the tracks were laid decades ago and turn too tightly, but I've
recently noticed that the trains make exactly the same awful noises on new
sections of track, so I assume it's something else.   This seems like a
workplace safety issue for the train operators, so I expect that the T would fix
it if they could (or I expect OSHA would make them fix it), but the screeching
continues. Does anyone know what causes these sounds, and why they are
apparently an integral part of the MBTA experience?

As an Everett resident, it is very annoying that the MBTA is putting us last
when it comes to expansion plans. We get a tiny little blurb in the "big ideas"
section of the 2040 plan, which means it will never happen. I understand the
Blue to Charles/MGH takes priority and makes sense, but it seems like so many
expansion plans make so little sense compared to this low-hanging fruit. I know
it's expensive, but so is the North-South rail connector, which is much more
technically difficult to do and will probably set MA transit back decades like
the Big Dig did.   At this stage in time, Everett is nearly unlivable. A car
ride from Glendale Square to Charlestown becomes damn near 20 minutes in peak
hours despite being maybe 5 with no traffic. Broadway is a one-lane street that
carries maybe even tens of thousands of trips a week, and those bus-only lanes
literally do nothing except bring traffic from a crawl to a standstill,
including for buses (Everett may be the single worst place to put bus-only
lanes). The casino makes traffic unbearable at nearly all hours of the day, and
they want to put a *major league soccer stadium* across from it. There's a
difference between being NIMBY and literally not having the roadway capacity for
more growth. Everett is also so incredibly dense that a *single subway station*
in Everett Square would serve well over half of the city's population. Orange
line spur to Casino - Downtown Everett needs to be a priority.

I recently started a job in which I’ll have to go inbound from Somerville to
Boston on the Medford/Tufts green line.  Can anyone share their experience with
best/worst times to ride inbound in the morning M-F? And bonus if you have
best/worst times to go outbound/return home in the afternoon. Trying to avoid
being packed in like a sardine if it’s possible.  Edit: I could also take the
orange line inbound, but will primarily take green.

Here are the Zone fares for the commuter rail. The Increase columns show how
much more each zone costs compared to the last one. The last column shows how
many single fares add up to a monthly pass
|Zone|One-Way|Increase|Monthly|Increase|x Single| |-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|1A|$2.40|\+$2.40|$90|\+$90|37.5| |1|$6.50|\+$4.10|$214|\+$124|\~32.9|
|2|$7.00|\+$0.50|$232|\+$18|\~33.1| |3|$8.00|\+$1.00|$261|\+$27|\~32.6|
|4|$8.75|\+$0.75|$281|\+$20|\~32.1| |5|$9.75|\+$1.00|$311|\+$30|\~31.9|
|6|$10.50|\+$0.75|$340|\+$29|\~32.3| |7|$11.00|\+$0.50|$360|\+$20|\~32.7|
|8|$12.25|\+$1.25|$388|\+$28|\~31.7| |9|$12.75|\+$0.50|$406|\+$18|\~31.8|
|10|$13.25|\+$0.50|$426|\+$20|\~32.2|  So what we learn is that zones 1 and 8
are more expensive than expected, while zones 2, 7, 9, and 10 are cheaper than
expected. The zone 1A monthly pass has the worst value and the zone 8 monthly
pass has the best value.  The interzone fares almost make sense if you ignore
the monthly pass prices:  |Interzone|One-Way|Increase|Monthly|Increase|x Single|
|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| | 1| $2.75|\+$2.75| $90|\+$90|\~32.7| | 2|
$3.25|\+$0.50|$110|\+$20|\~33.8| | 3|~~$3.75~~
**$3.50**|\+$0.25|$120|\+$10|\~34.3| | 4| $4.25|\+$0.75|$139|\+$19|\~32.7| | 5|
$4.75|\+$0.50|$158|\+$19|\~33.3| | 6| $5.25|\+$0.50|$178|\+$20|\~33.9| | 7|
$5.75|\+$0.50|$196|\+$18|\~34.1| | 8| $6.25|\+$0.50|$216|\+$20|\~34.6| | 9|
$6.75|\+$0.50|$237|\+$21|\~35.1| |10| $7.25|\+$0.50|$257|\+$20|\~35.5|  The
single fare _almost_ follows a pattern: $2.25+$0.50 per zone. But the Interzone
3 fare is $0.25 cheaper than expected. Meanwhile, the monthly pass prices
clearly aren't scaling correctly since they just get worse and worse the farther
out you go starting from IZ4.  Did MBTA just pull these numbers from a hat?

__________________  Raw sewage in Alewife Brook: The unfinished chapter of
Boston Harbor cleanup By Hadley Barndollar | HBarndollar@masslive.com  When the
flood waters receded in the basement of Kristin Anderson’s Arlington home, she
found toilet paper, condoms and tampon applicators strewn throughout, left
behind by the dirty water.  Afterward, she suffered through days of sickness,
namely painful gastrointestinal issues. It was then she realized the Alewife
Brook had quite literally entered her home, and with it, raw sewage.  “It came
right in through the back door after the brook overflowed its banks,” Anderson
recalled. “It was pretty traumatic.”  In Cambridge, where the Alewife Brook
originates, a single outfall pipe located behind the graffiti-laden Alewife MBTA
parking garage is a leading source of sewage discharged into the brook during
periods of heavy rainfall — which data shows are only getting heavier because of
climate change.  It’s an issue that traces back decades to the Boston Harbor
Cleanup case, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency embarked on an
all-hands-on-deck approach to what was, at the time, considered one of the
dirtiest harbors in America.  The court-mandated projects cost more than $4
billion, spurred by two 1980s lawsuits that ultimately led a federal judge to
require the construction of the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant and
supplemental cleanup endeavors.  Today, Boston Harbor is often highlighted as a
national EPA enforcement success story. However, outlying pieces still remain,
such as the sewage issue in the Alewife Brook.  In 2023 alone, 26 million total
gallons of untreated sewage were discharged into the brook, making it the site
of the highest concentration of sewage outfall in the Boston area, according to
the Mystic River Watershed Association.  Data shows about two-thirds of it comes
from the particular outfall labeled by the city of Cambridge as CAM 401A, which
remains noncompliant with the Boston Harbor cleanup plan and sits
inconspicuously on the edge of the Alewife Brook Reservation.  Approximately
5,000 people live in the Alewife Brook’s 100-year flood plain between Cambridge,
Arlington and Belmont. And with the nearby MBTA station and new developments
containing luxury apartments and biotech companies, thousands of people traverse
around the river daily — and specifically, the 401A outfall known to spill over
onto walking paths.  Photos have circulated over the years of a father pushing a
baby stroller through sewage on a path. A young girl riding her bike through
what appears to be rain puddles — but aren’t.  “We aren’t supposed to be coming
into contact with untreated, raw sewage,” said Marja Copeland, stormwater
project manager for the Mystic River Watershed Association.  State-mandated plan
update  The city of Cambridge completed a project in 2013 that separated sewer
and stormwater pipe infrastructure for more than 420 acres. It featured the
creation of the Alewife Stormwater Wetland, a massive nature-based solution for
stormwater management that essentially “pre-treats” stormwater before it flows
into the river.  At that time, it cost more than $150 million. Future sewer
projects in Cambridge — such as pipe separation, sewage storage tanks, tunnels
and more — will certainly surpass that.  And according to the federal Clean
Water Act’s water quality standards, sewage isn’t supposed to be discharged into
Alewife Brook. The state, however, has issued temporary variances to allow it
while the involved parties work toward additional solutions.  Toilet paper and
“floatables” — really anything that is flushed down the toilet — can be seen
buoyant in Alewife Brook during combined sewer overflow (CSO) events. Homeless
encampments had to be moved from the area several times, the individuals
entirely unaware of what they were exposed to when hard rain fell.  “We’re
talking hundreds of millions to billions,” said Lucica Hiller, a senior project
manager for Cambridge’s Department of Public Works. “I think in general we
expect these projects to be funded by water and sewer rates and property taxes.
There’s limited federal funding for this type of work.”  Currently, Cambridge,
Somerville and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) are updating
their long-term controlled sewer overflow plans that were required by the Boston
Harbor federal court case, charting a course for future improvements that will,
they hope, decimate sewer discharge.  The first iteration of the approved plan,
completed in 2015, included 35 projects that cost more than $900 million.
Hrycyna called the sewer overflows into Alewife Brook an example of “the
recalcitrant, last, unfinished chapter of the cleanup of Boston Harbor.”  An
updated long-term control plan was one of the requirements set forth by the
state Department of Environmental Protection when it granted variances from
Clean Water Act standards to permit sewer discharge into the Alewife Brook,
while the MWRA and its partner communities implement solutions.  It’s a public
health concern, but also an ecological one — Alewife Brook is regularly reported
to have some of the worst water quality in the Boston area, affecting the
ability of wildlife to thrive, as well as human recreation.  “The amount of
sewage pollution in that brook, it’s just unfathomable when you look at the size
of it,” said Anderson, the Arlington resident who ultimately formed Save the
Alewife Brook, a grassroots community group of residents working to end sewer
discharge into the river.  What are combined sewer overflows?  On a wet morning
in May, Copeland and her colleague Andy Hrycyna, water quality program manager
for the Mystic River Watershed Association, walked around a MassLive reporter
around Alewife Brook Reservation.  The surrounding area has become densely
populated as development has risen — and continues to — around the Alewife MBTA
station. The more impervious surfaces that are created, the more stormwater
runoff generated. And making matters worse, intense storms are hitting more
frequently.  On May 22, for example, heavy rain struck parts of Massachusetts in
what forecasters called a late-season nor’easter. Between 6:30 p.m. that day and
1 a.m. the next morning, sewage discharged from the 401A outfall behind the MBTA
parking garage into Alewife Brook.  Through its combined sewer overflow alert
system, the city of Cambridge told the public to avoid contact for 48 hours
because of “increased health risks due to bacteria or other pollutants carried
by the stormwater, such as fertilizers or pesticides.”  In those discharge
instances, “the capacity of that pipe of combined sewage and stormwater is
exceeded,” Hrycyna explained while pointing to the 401A outfall. “And instead of
backing up into the streets or into people’s homes, it’s designed literally to
overflow into a river.”  And yet, sewage can still end up in homes as a result
of flooding, as exemplified by the ordeal at Anderson’s Arlington home.  When
city infrastructure was built in the mid-to-late 1800s, combined sewer outfalls
were widely adopted as best practice, where wastewater and stormwater would
discharge together, out of one pipe, into waterways.  Combined sewer overflows
represent a “legacy of pollution, industrialization and historic infrastructure
systems that no longer work in the cities that we have today,” Copeland said.
However, eliminating combined sewer overflows involves undoing decisions of the
past regarding complicated underground infrastructure — an incredibly costly
endeavor. Progress has certainly been made over the last few decades, but the
issue remains front and center in areas like the Alewife Brook.  According to
the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, of the 86 CSO outfalls active in
the late 1980s in the Boston Harbor area, 45 remain active today. The estimated
annual discharge figure has also decreased from 3.3 billion gallons in the late
1980s to 401 million gallons now.  The most recent variances were issued last
August.  The outcomes of the updated plan, Hiller said, will be a combination of
alternatives aimed at reducing combined sewer overflows. A draft is expected to
be submitted in December, at which time officials will present to the public,
the Department of Environmental Protection and EPA “what we think is feasible in
terms of construction and what is also affordable.”  “It’s definitely not sexy
to talk about sewer and combined sewer overflows,” Hiller said. “And at the end
of the day, this work is expensive, and I know people don’t like talking about
raising taxes. But it comes at a cost. Leaving this region better for our
children and our children’s children is not cheap.”  In Western Massachusetts,
Holyoke will soon begin the $30 million separation of stormwater and wastewater
in a section of the city to reduce pollution of the Connecticut River.  In
September 2023, a judge approved an agreement between the EPA and Holyoke to fix
violations of the Clean Water Act caused by sewer overflows.  ‘Forced exposure
to hazardous sewage’  Other related efforts are occurring simultaneously, both
locally and at the state level.  The Cambridge City Council recently passed a
policy order urging Gov. Maura Healey and the MBTA to rewrite their request for
proposals for the pending redevelopment at the Alewife Station complex to
“ensure that this project plays a central role in ending raw sewage discharges
into Alewife Brook.”  Proposed legislation in front of state lawmakers would
require the effective elimination of combined sewer overflows in the
Massachusetts Water Resource Authority’s service area, by ending the dumping of
untreated sewage during storms considered a 25-year event (the largest storm in
25 years) or smaller — by 2035 at the latest.  Members of Save the Alewife Brook
are eager for the relevant entities and officials to take meaningful action.
They’ve advocated at city council meetings, in front of the state Legislature
and been part of the public comment process for a new long-term control plan.
But they remain skeptical, they said, given the legacy effects of CSOs in the
area.  “These entities could do it, probably some combination of more sewer
separation and tunnel storage and some green infrastructure,” said Gene Benson,
a Save the Alewife Brook member and Arlington resident. “They’re the engineers.
The problem is they don’t have the incentive to go ahead and do it.”  Benson
believes the long-term control plan process is “deeply, deeply flawed.”  “And
that’s why here we are in 2025 and the brook still has, you know, incredible
amount of CSOs going into it every year,” he said. Specifically, the group takes
issue with the use of a “typical year” for data measurements, as years are
becoming less predictable because of climate change, they said.  “This is forced
exposure to hazardous sewage,” Anderson said.   ____________ Photo of Marja
Copeland, stormwater project manager for the Mystic River Watershed, points to a

amount of raw sewage discharge in the area. (Hadley Barndollar / MassLive)

I’ve ridden in them many times, but this is the first day my commute to work is
one of them. The smooth, slippery, plastic seats are the worst! I can’t relax at
all! I have to have both feet firmly planted and my entire body tensed lest the
slightest braking send my entire body sliding into the person next to me. It’s
absurd how flat and frictionless these seats are. I can feel my sit bones
grinding into the plastic. I get the cars have more room to pack people in and I
get that plastic is generally cleaner than the old fabric seats, but idk, I
never cared about how clean the fabric that my pants touched was. Not enough to
swap it for the frictionless wonder of the new seats.

I live in Watertown, not far from Waverley. I have been commuting to Government
Center on the 73/Red Line connection at Harvard to Park Street every day. It’s
cheap, but the bus connection—especially in the evenings—is the worst part of my
day.   I’ve done the 73 outbound (towards Waverley) and picked up the commuter
rail, a few times and it has been like flying first class compared to the daily
BS with the 73 from Harvard and the Red Line. It’s a nice, smooth ride right to
North Station, and I just walk from there to Government Center.  I looked into
the monthly zone passes and I have no idea how the hell these work. Can I get
any type of pre-tax commuter rail pass, like with Perq? How do the zones work?
It looks like it's over $200 a month, and that just feels like a rip-off to me.

I have been relying on the 73 to get me to Harvard every day for about 7 months
now, and over the last few weeks, it has started to become the worst part of my
day.  The bus simply doesn’t run frequently enough to meet demand. For example,
if all goes well and I get on the bus at around 7:20 am on Belmont Street, it
will be quiet, and everyone gets a seat, and we fly right into Harvard (even
with slightly heavy traffic as we near West Cambridge). If there is a slight
delay and the bus runs late or is outright canceled—which I feel like has been
happening more and more around the 7:20 am-7:45 am window—by the time the bus
creeps up to Mount Auburn Hospital, it is packed to the gills. Simply put, a
10-minute difference can significantly impact everyone's commute, and I feel
like it happens almost daily at this point.  The same drama occurs on the ride
home. During peak rush hour, particularly between 5:00 pm and 5:20 pm, the
headways between buses are unpredictable and unreliable. By the time one comes
to the Harvard Bus Way, the same thing happens—the platform is absolutely
packed, and it takes double the time to even get out of Harvard Square.  I am no
transit expert, but I feel like if the 73 ran on an every-15 or better service,
like the new 109 improvement, it would lead to less congestion and better
service for West Cambridge, Watertown, and Belmont, even with rush hour traffic

Some Highlights:  Relevant to commuter rail:  * Frequent all-day service, rather
than just at rush hour, with more regular stopping patterns * Mode-neutral
fares, charging the same as urban rail within the city, and allowing free
transfers with buses in the suburbs * More stations within the city, or at least
not skipping the existing urban stations on most trains * Electrification of all
lines, and the purchase of new modern, self-propelled trains
(so-called *electric multiple units* or *EMUs*) * High platforms at all
stations, to enable fast, wheelchair-accessible boarding  &gt;Moreover,
electrification and high platforms both substantially increase speed and
reliability: our schedule for the Providence Line, using EMUs and high-platform
stations, shortens the Boston-Providence local trip time to 47 minutes from
today’s 72. This is crucial for intercity rail improvements: speeding up the
slower trains makes it easier to timetable the faster trains on shared track.  #
Policy Recommendations  &gt;Our proposal is based on integration of
infrastructure planning, schedule planning, and rolling stock and other
technical standards. As such, our recommendations start from a better framework
for allowing such planning. Policymakers must be ready to address all of the
following points to make the most of the NEC and allow low-cost high-speed rail
service on it.  &gt;**Coordinate planning NEC-wide**  &gt;The federal government
and state agencies must establish a coordinating planning body for the NEC, with
the authority to plan schedules, infrastructure, and rolling stock purchases.
This necessarily reduces the autonomy of each agency using the NEC, but in truth
they are all deriving their funding from the same pot of FRA money for NEC
improvements. There already is some coordination in the form of projects like
NEC Future and now Connect
2035,[^(\[17\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n17) which
essentially staple together different agency wishlists. To build high-speed rail
on the NEC for $17 billion rather than $110 billion, it is necessary to go
further with this coordination and instead build an integrated Northeastern Takt
timetable, binding Amtrak and all commuter rail agencies.  &gt;**Adopt best
standards for systems and rolling stock**  &gt;The best standards are well
within American regulations in 2025, but are not within the American railroading
tradition. These include lightly modified European equipment, modern
implementations of such systems as turnouts and catenary, and lower-cost ways of
delivering projects as we’ve recommended for subway
construction.[^(\[18\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n18) It
is particularly important to learn how to make the most of the higher
performance specifications of modern equipment, including not just imported
European trainsets but also back-of-the-house equipment like track laying
machines. In the medium run, American railroad agencies should send their mid-
and early-career staff to foreign conferences and symposiums to learn best
practices and assimilate them domestically.  &gt;**Fund the Connect 2035
projects required for high-speed schedules**  &gt;Among the projects under
discussion but not yet funded, there are ones that stand out as necessary to
build. The federal government should fund them immediately, using remaining
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds. They may be critical enough that even
without federal funding, state funding may be cost-effective.  &gt;The most
important of those are the NJ Transit capacity improvements: Hunter Flyover, the
Mid-Line Loop, and the mid-level movable version of the Portal South Bridge,
which are projected to cost a total of $1.7 billion in 2024 prices. A grade
separation of New Rochelle, at CP 216, is required as well and if anything more
important than Hunter and Mid-Line, but is at an earlier stage of development,
whereas the NJ Transit projects are ready for BIL construction funding.
&gt;**Deprioritize Penn Expansion and other projects that can be avoided through
better timetabling**  &gt;The largest items on the Connect 2035 list are the
expansion of New York Penn Station and its reconstruction. These do not further
this goal of coordinated timetabling and should not proceed. The infrastructure
investment section gives some details; for more details, see ETA’s report and
simulations of Penn
Station.[^(\[19\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n19) A
handful of Penn Reconstruction vertical circulation work is prudent, but is a
small fraction of the overall project, which lacks any itemized costs allowing
the public or even the FRA to review its budget breakdown.  &gt;**Remove State
of Good Repair from the list of projects**  &gt;Funding bridge replacements and
state of good repair (SOGR) out of a pot of money designed for a megaproject
leads to bloat, and designing a common capital program for both long-term
maintenance and expansion leads to a program that works poorly for both.
Megaprojects are inherently risky, and extravagant definitions of the projects
decided long before any public debate are
routine.[^(\[20\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n20) The
one factor limiting cost growth is that they are flashy and the public comes to
expect that the megaproject, such as a high-speed rail line or a subway line,
will open. Maintenance and renewal lack this limit, and can only work if funded
on an ongoing basis, based on regular performance metrics. SOGR in effect weds
the worst problems of megaprojects (cost overruns) with the worst problems of
non-megaproject investment (lack of visible progress checking the project).
&gt;Indeed, one can compare Connecticut’s SOGR program with rail renewal
programs in Germany. Connecticut spent $700-900 million a year on rail
infrastructure and equipment in
2017-21,[^(\[21\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n21) or
about $990 million in 2024 prices, for a network comprising about 780 track-km
(485 track-miles) and 370 route-km (230 route-miles). The long-term renewal of
the Hanover-Würzburg line, required once in several decades (the line opened in
1991), was 850 million
euros,[^(\[22\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n22) or
$1.43 billion in 2024 prices, for 327 route-km of which 120 are in tunnel, or
654 track-km (406 track-miles). Once in a generation renewal in Germany costs
only 70% more than the annual infrastructure cost in Connecticut, where renewal
is a never-ending process in which at any point in time, some section of the New
Haven Line is out of service and many are under slow orders.  &gt;In lieu of the
failed SOGR program, we recommend that maintenance be funded on the same rolling
basis as operations, and that methods be realigned with best practices,
including highly mechanized trackwork using track laying machines working an
entire section at once rather than labor-intensive manual inspections of the
fixed plant.  &gt;**Add strategic bypasses to the Connect 2035 list and begin
design work on them immediately**  &gt;There are projects on the Connect 2035
list that we recommend moving forward with and ones we recommend canceling. Then
there are projects not on the list, or heavily modified from the list, that
should be built. These are high priorities for planning, as they are in a less
advanced state than the already approved projects just waiting for funding.
&gt;These include all of the bypasses that we outline, including not just the $5
billion New Haven-Kingston bypass, but also $5 billion in New Haven Line
bypasses described in the high-investment scenario. In a low-investment
scenario, it is likely that only the New Haven-Kingston bypass deserves to be
funded for construction, as it saves 32 minutes whereas the New Haven Line
bypasses save 7 minutes for about the same cost. However, it is better to
preplan projects and then see how much money is available in capital expansion
funding than to scramble for planning funds when money becomes
available.[^(\[23\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n23)
&gt;This also includes a Cos Cob Bridge replacement. The replacement planned is
not a critical project, and is excessively expensive at $4.25 billion for less
than 2 kilometers (a little more than a mile) of
trackwork.[^(\[24\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n24) Ordinarily,
we would call for cancellation, as we do elsewhere. However, an alternative
alignment incorporating rebuilding the bridge would ease some short, sharp
curves, and is included, with suggestions for how to use more modern rail
standards to reduce costs.

Within just a four-month period, two alarming crashes involving Green Line
trains reminded commuters of the not-so-old bad days before recent upgrades to
tracks and equipment resulted in notably faster rides that have helped resurrect
the MBTA’s image.  But largely out of view was a high number of derailments of
maintenance vehicles, 41 in 2024, during an intense period of construction over
the last year when the transit agency repaired and replaced decrepit tracks.
Beyond provoking yet another admonition from federal regulators over unsafe
working conditions, the sheer number of incidents helped earn the MBTA the
dubious distinction of having the most derailments of any metro public transit
system over the past five years by a wide margin: more than 100, according to a
Globe analysis of federal and T data, nearly three-quarters of which involved
maintenance vehicles.  (There’s more in the article but I don’t have a

Title: "The MBTA Needs a Long-Term Vision – Or We’ll Pay the Price"

Greater Boston is a region of big ideas. The MBTA, however, isn’t thinking big
enough.  Massachusetts lacks a coherent strategy for its transit future. Without
it, construction costs will keep rising, congestion will worsen, and housing
development will continue to be shaped by today’s transit map – locking in car
dependency for generations.  The state keeps solving yesterday’s problems
instead of anticipating tomorrow’s needs. A world-class transit system drives
business investment, increases property values and unlocks commercial growth.
But we’re letting short-term funding limitations dictate our region’s future.
The result? A region struggling with some of the worst traffic congestion in the
country and a housing crisis exacerbated by poor transit access.  # Planning
Saves Money  A city and region this wealthy should have a transit system that
meets people where they live.  That means fully electrified, high-frequency
regional rail. It means robust bus service, not just in the core but in the
suburbs, where development pressures are shifting. It means aligning transit
investment with real estate development and ensuring businesses and housing are
built around transit – projects like Boston Landing and Assembly Row have shown
that this is successful.  The Green Line Extension (GLX) was a bespoke project
from an agency that hadn’t built a major rapid transit extension in three
decades, and the price tag reflected this.  GLX lingered in planning limbo for
30 years, accumulating cost and complexity. Meanwhile, Montreal planned, funded,
and opened the first 10 miles of an automated light metro system – the REM – at
a fraction of the GLX’s per-mile cost in 8 years.  That’s the difference between
a long-term vision and lurching from project to project. Other regions are
reaping the benefits of sustained investment.  # CRE Loses Out Without T Vision
We’re already paying the price for the MBTA’s lack of planning.  Municipalities
make land-use decisions based on today’s transit network, locking in car
dependency for decades. A missing rail station or a slow bus connection might
not seem like a big deal, but these gaps shape where people live and work.  The
result is predictable: too little housing near reliable transit, too much
sprawl, and clogged roads. For the CRE industry, this presents a real challenge:
commercial and mixed-use developments thrive in areas with transit connectivity,
but the state isn’t giving investors the certainty they need.  The Fairmount
Line electrification pilot is a rare bright spot – a sign of what’s possible
when we think ahead. But it’s also a reminder of how much work remains. While
Toronto is delivering nearly 20 miles of light rail, a 5-mile subway extension
and a revamped commuter rail system with electrified service every 15 minutes,
Boston is still debating what kind of system it needs instead of committing to a
vision.  Transit expansion is an investment strategy – one that directly
benefits the CRE industry. Well-planned transit increases property values,
stabilizes commercial markets, and provides long-term resilience. But
Massachusetts treats it as an afterthought, which is why we keep falling behind.
# What the T Needs  We need a commitment to long-term transit expansion, not
just reactive projects driven by short-term funding.  This means bold,
forward-looking choices – prioritizing regional rail electrification, infill
stations and frequent, all-day service across the MBTA network. It also means a
structured plan – one that developers, businesses and municipalities can rely
on.  Over the next five years, Massachusetts should expand electrification
pilots and implement transit-oriented zoning reforms to lay the groundwork for
future growth. Within 10 to 15 years, we must move beyond incremental
improvements and commit to full regional rail electrification while establishing
dedicated funding sources.  Over the next three decades, the goal should be a
transit network enabling car-free living at scale – reshaping where people live
and work, strengthening the state’s economic competitiveness, and ensuring
Greater Boston remains a leader in sustainable urban development.  For all of
Massachusetts’ political divisions, transit is one of the few areas of
widespread agreement. Leaders acknowledge traffic congestion is unsustainable,
housing costs are out of control and better transit options are needed. The
challenge is turning that understanding into action.  For CRE professionals,
this means engaging early in transit planning – pushing municipalities to adopt
transit-oriented zoning, advocating for state investment in transit corridors
and ensuring that the next decade of development is built around transit, not
auto-centricity.  # We Can’t Afford a Wish List  The MBTA has a long-range plan
in development. That’s a start.  But we can’t afford another bureaucratic
exercise that results in a wish list without commitment or a vague plan with no
timeline, funding strategy, or private sector engagement.  The plan needs to be
realistic but ambitious. It must address the scale of the region’s challenges
and be proactive, not just a list of projects that might happen if funding
appears someday.  The risks of inaction are too great: falling behind peer
cities, worsening congestion and stunted housing production. But the
opportunities are enormous. A well-planned, well-funded transit network could
transform how people live and work across Greater Boston.  The commercial real
estate industry has a vested interest in a functional transit system. CRE
leaders should be vocal in pushing for ambitious transit expansion – because the
health of their investments and the strength of the region’s economy depend on
it.  We have the chance to build something lasting. Now is the time to seize it.

For too long, the state of Massachusetts has failed to provide support to the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Ever since the change in the
financial backing via a sales tax system that did not keep up with the changing
times in the 2000s, the MBTA has slowly began to fall apart.   We have seen
fires on trains. We have seen the death of people who should still be alive by
now. We have seen projects that have been continuously being delayed, letting
communities down that rely on the MBTA. We have seen multiple derailments. We
are seeing a 700 million dollar deficit for the budget for next fiscal year.
Service has been a major problem over the last couple of years. An increase of
slow zones until the implementation of the Track Improvement Program, aging
infrastructure, and bad headways combine for service that is not what we
deserve. We should not be waiting upwards of 20 minutes for an outbound train to
Braintree or Ashmont. We should have better communication for meetings (such as
the South Coast Rail meeting that only was announced the day before) or when a
line goes down (like today with the Red Line).  The people of Boston deserve
better. Low income families deserve better. People of color in Boston deserve
better. The greater Boston area deserves better.   That is why today, I am
announcing that I will be working on an event that will hopefully bring
attention to this crisis. I want to bring awareness to the fact that people
should care about the potential impact of the MBTA shutting down in the next
couple of years. To do this, I would like to have speakers talk about their
experiences with the MBTA, pass out flyers to riders about the issues that the
MBTA is facing and how the state government has not responded to these concerns,
and call out state legislators and Governor Healey to actually make funding the
MBTA a major priority in the next legislative session.  Some may say that the
MBTA should just fail, that it is an embarrassment, that we, as the MBTA
community, are a bunch of “defenders of a bad system”. I say this: many people
that you rely on use the MBTA as their only source of transportation. Without
the MBTA, thousands of people will lose access to their jobs, healthcare,
education, food/clothing, government services, and the things that we rely on to
live. Traffic will become unbearable at a time where we are known for having the
worst traffic in the United States, especially during games/events at Fenway or
TD Garden. Less people are going to head to Boston as a result, causing a
slowing economy in Boston and in turn Massachusetts. College students will begin
not considering Boston as a place to study or live in, one of the biggest
population and fuelers of said economy. Tourism will begin to suffer because
tourists will have to rely on Ubers and cabs that will inevitably become very
expensive because the demand for them will increase to a point where very few
people will be able to get one or afford them. Services like BlueBikes will
suffer the same issues because there will be not enough bikes to meet demand.
Low-income families will not have any other way to feed their families or
support them. People will leave Massachusetts in droves because people will get
fed up with all of the issues I just mentioned here.  For those who would like
to help support, please let me know. Thank you.

So, in my personal opinion, the green line is *by far* the worst line of the 4
major lines. There's just so many problems with it:  1. Obviously, the slow
zones that plague the MBTA as a whole, particularly the green and red lines. 2.
It has such frequent stops that it spends a ton of time in station,
accelerating, and decelerating, which adds up, and a ton of the stops are super
redundant. 3. It's light rail, which means that even when the track is free from
slow zones and it does manage to get up to max speed before having to slow down
for the next station, it's significantly slower than the other lines. 4. Parts
of it come above ground and aren't fully separated from the street, meaning you
have to wait *in traffic* on a *train*, which is just absurd. 5. It has 4
separate branches, which makes it so that you have to wait so much longer to get
any train if you're past Kenmore, or for the right train if you're before
Kenmore but want to get past it. Plus, there's so many trains once you get past
Kenmore that they always have to wait to actually get into the station! (And
obviously the additional split at Copley makes it that much worse in addition to
the Kenmore split.)  The first one is currently being worked on, and I can't
imagine the second would be too difficult to change, but the rest seem a lot
more difficult to fix. Obviously, it's literally the oldest subway system in the
country, and while having that title is nice, I'd much rather have quality over
history. It being outdated for a bit is understandable, but eventually, it
should really be updated. Surely, we shouldn't have to deal with the green line
constantly being miles behind the other lines just because it was built first
forever, right? Does anyone here know how feasible it would be to actually
update it significantly, ideally including points 3,  and 5, especially 3? Or
are we just gonna have to put up with it forever?

Anyone that takes more than one line has seen the improvement in speed on the
Green and Orange line. And the improvement in reliability on the Orange Line due
to new trains.  But the Red Line is currently in the worst shape. I don't think
people understand that the Red Line issues are combination of factors: bad
track, old trains.  While Eng promises improvement to the track by the end of
this year. The new trains are still nowhere in sight, as CRRC has to complete
the Orange Line order before continuing to Red.   Looking at the New Train
Tracker, it appears that CRRC still has to deliver 48 more orange line train
cars before they can go to Red.  TLDR: The orange line is only more reliable now
because it has New Trains + Fixed Track. It will be many years before Red Line
catches up with new trains. Even if the track is fixed tomorrow, service is only
as reliable as 50+ year old trains.

Title: LET’s TALK ABOUT: Missing transit links in nearby cities and Op-Ed piece about more transit options in Watertown

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 EDIT: This post has been reposted due to an error I made mixed Co-ed with Op-ed
due to a user pointing this out. I appreciate this and apologize for this
incorrect terminology.  This is a Op-ed that Guest Writer Mark Pickering wrote
about the need for more bus and transit options in Watertown. I want to first
highlight some important ideas  - “…Levity aside, the plan to send the No. 71
buses across the river to the MBTA’s Watertown Yard sounds like a bad idea. It
puts more traffic on the narrow bridge and accomplishes pretty much nothing, as
far as transportation goes. Looking at the big picture, two parts of the
Watertown transit system work reasonably well. That would be the No. 71 bus to
Harvard Square and the Mass Pike. The current Watertown Square redesign plan
sends the No. 71 over the river, with no dedicated bus lanes. That would add
even more of traffic to the bridge and, to some degree, undermine the No. 71
service”.  - “The No. 70 is the missing link in the current Watertown Square
plan, which ignores this connection entirely. The big picture here: No
reasonable person would look at the No. 70 route and see it as a bus line. It
goes through some of the worst traffic bottlenecks in Greater Boston including
the Charles River mess where Mass. Pike ramps, local traffic, Storrow Drive and
Memorial Drive all crash together”.  - “The bus route does, however, look more
like an extension of the Red Line. If the MBTA got going on that right away,
that would make a lot of sense.  - “Now, there’s money available for new
projects that was not there before. That’s because the so-called Millionaires
Tax creates a new pool of money, hopefully to fix Massachusetts transit woes.
Watertown deserves to be at the top of the list for getting that cash”.  - “In
contrast, when the MBTA tore down the elevated Orange Line, Roxbury got some
stops on the new Orange Line and numerous dedicated bus lanes heading into
Dudley Station. The state and the MBTA are to blame for Watertown’s woeful
public transit service. They need to ante up”.  When it comes to regional
transit, areas such as Weymouth, Braintree/Milton, Watertown, and Lynn deserves
more bus service and, hopefully, subway expansions that better serve these
communities and help free the housing hellscape that is Boston by adding more
rapid transit aside from the Commuter Rail. It will add more transit-orienting
housing (like what the Malden-Everett-Chelsea area has been able to do) and
provide thousands of new jobs for everyone. Adding more bus-only lanes and
improving bus infrastructure can help with this, but this should be coming from
the state first, with the T helping to make these things actually happen  (when
the T gets back on its’ feet).  What do y’all think about my thoughts and the
Op-Ed piece? Can’t wait to have this discussion.

You say the commuter rail is supposed to be better than the T, eh? And that
justifies why it's so ridiculously expensive?   Explain to me why I got on the
Greenbush line (train #076) at Quincy Center to go to South Station, a trip that
normally takes 15 minutes. And instead, it took over an hour because we were
stopped just outside of South Station.   I left QC at 8:55. We could not step
off the train onto South Station until 9:57.   The employees were saying it was
due to a signal failure.  This is insane. I pay more for a commuter rail pass
because it should save me time compared to the T, but this isn't the only time
it's been delayed. I think this was the absolute worst I've experienced, but
I've also experienced delays of 30+ minutes where most of the people waiting for
the CR give up and get on the RL.   Was anyone else there? And if anyone could
chime in about what we can do to begin to advocate for improved service, that'd
be great. I've only lived in Boston for 1.5 years and the bureaucracy is
extremely (and probably intentionally) difficult to navigate.

Title: Seems like the orange line is the worst when it comes to random men harassing women and children

Yesterday evening it was a man whose eyes were bloodshot and was slurring his
words bothering a couple caregivers with their two small children. I felt bad
witnessing them just gray rock him til hopefully they could get to their
destination without needing to respond more seriously. But eventually one of
them just straight up told him it was enough, to not speak to children and to
leave them alone. That was before a bunch of other people boarded too, at which
point he turned his attention to any other woman he could bother.  I think he
had tried to speak to me at one point but I had my earbuds in, I ignored him, I
ended up pausing my music and turning off the noise cancelation surreptitiously
to be able to intervene if necessary.  Also he borderline assaulted a woman
leaving the train at downtown crossing, he’d shoved his way through the crowd of
people in the subway car at the last minute before the doors closed and in the
process literally had his arm around a woman’s neck briefly as he exited — not
that it was intentional but he obviously didn’t care either, people literally
gasped collectively.  With few exceptions I won’t proactively interfere in a
scenario like that, of someone harassing others on the T, if it hasn’t already
escalated, e.g. they’re able to brush him off while they can. For example once
an elderly man with a cane was sitting next to women and asking them for money
repeatedly, by the third person I just told him to stop harassing women and that
I was so close to calling the cops on him, it worked in that situation. But
obviously I’m not going to insert myself in a situation where it could make
things unsafe, hope that goes without saying.  If anyone needs mace they sell it
at the army/navy store downtown, I don’t leave my house without it. It’s only a
few times a year at most that I ever feel like I might need to actually use it
to protect myself because there are enough loose cannons in Boston.  Anyone have
similar stories? Is there a way to alert mbta personnel quietly when something
like that is happening?

Got on the orange line at Wellington (towards Forest Hills) right around 7:30am
today. As soon as the doors shut and the train got close to full speed, the
conductor decided to SLAM on the brakes and reopen the doors before leaving the
station for good. I was one of the few people standing up in my car, and got
thrown basically on top of another person who was sitting down (pulled a couple
muscles in my calf/hamstring too in the process trying to stop myself).  I
realize this is far from the worst thing to ever happen on the OL, but I still
found it pretty dangerous. This is also like the third “stop short from full
speed” I’ve experienced on the OL in the past couple months. Anyone else
experience this today/recently? Am I overreacting?

I am going to a concert at the stadium in a couple of weeks and trying to figure
out logistics for getting there and back. Never been there before. I can drive
and park but have heard it is very chaotic and traffic might be bad. I am
considering taking the commuter rail but the schedule doesn't have anything
coming back towards South Station past 10pm, do they still do the special event
trains that supposedly leave 30 mins after the event? The mbta page that has
info about this is from like 2021.  To make the commute worse I live near
Quincy/Braintree stations so definitely not going up to South Station to come
back down to Foxboro. Was thinking of parking at Dedham Corporate center or a
station near that one and take commuter rail from there. Worst case scenario
could take an uber back but I dunno maybe at that point I should just
drive.......? ? Suggestions on what to do ? Experiences parking at the stadium?
Experiences taking the rail after an event and getting off somewhere not South
Station? Thank you!!  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT - just found a more updated event train
page and my event is listed. Does anyone know if the return/after event train
will still make stops or does it go straight to South Station?

Ok let's debate about the financial issues with the t. As someone who has a
reduced fare card I feel like it needs to be said that a lower fare is the
sensible choice for the t. I also feel conflicted about it since i know they
need more revenue but the prices are just hsrd to justify. They operate a system
that is trying the publics patience. Why should I pay full price for busses
&amp; trains that run slower than they used to while making us wait longer? Why
is it fair that the CR inconveniences people who want to use it on the weekends
over those who use it on weekdays? Why should someone looking for a weekend
getaway have to wait twice as long as the person commuting for work during the
week?  CR prices are ridiculously expensive due to the zone structure. Why dose
it cost more to go to/from  boston to Wachusett,  Worcester Haverhill or in the
worst example wickford junction compared to someone who might be closer to the
city? Whu should someone from Waltham or Malden or Newton pay less? There needs
to be a drastic change in how fares are charged. $10 weekend passes are a
godsend if it works for you.   Tldr  We need to seriously look at the t fare
structure &amp; think about changing it to match the level of current service.

OK the MBTA has its problems including the commuter rail but I have never seen
there what I am experiencing right now. I am on the Metro North line to Grand
Central in Manhattan. Outside of Harlem it stopped for close to 60 minutes due
to signal and power problems.  Then the conductor explained we need to backward.
So went backwards passing many other similarly stopped trains in order to change
tracks. Now we are told we are going to another station botanical gardens not on
original trip for those who want to get off, then for those who stay we will
change tracks and try again to get to Grand Central.  I got on this train 90
minutes ago for a 15 minute ride and now we are still going backwards.   Update:
we just reached botanical gardens many got off. Now conductor said all those
trains we passed are ahead of us to get to Grand Central. He has no idea how
long it will take us to Grand Central  I will take anything I have ever
experienced on the T over this.  Update: I got on this train at 4:50 pm. Current
time is7:56. One person jumped out emergency window in another car about 20
minutes ago. We are starting to move now. Again, T on its worst day is never
this bad.

Of all things that bug people about the T, "not caring" about customers seems to
be the worst.  So some cars get turned at park st - mostly to keep them 'on
schedule' - it allows them to turn and go outbound faster, but inconveniences
everyone.    They don't care.  Today it really bugged me though, since the GL
was bussing between GC and NS.   So rather than just sending the blasted train
to GC, it dumped everyone at Park, forcing them to wait for a train to go one
station to be thrown off again for a bus.     &amp;#x200B;  Just venting.

Every glimpse of excitement that I felt at the sight of the new orange line
train was immediately lost as I took a seat in it. Let's start from there : The
seats are uncomfortable and they are fewer than the ones in the old train. The
a/c  / fan, which is placed right behind them, constantly slaps your neck with
cold air. People will start coughing because of it and that won't be a relaxed
ride to work. And the lights inside are just too bright for my poor morning
vision. Also, having multiple people watching videos with their speakers on
right next to your side ( come on people!) isn't the end of your irritation. Now
the doors, while staying open, produce an alarm-like sound repeatedly, which
becomes even more intense while they are closing. The worst part is that the
train can't even pass faster between stations that are known to have speed
limits ( I am assuming these exist due to safety precautions). I would rather
they fixed these damn trails or anything that goes wrong at those locations and
make the trains skip them with the usual speed. For last, I calculated the ride
and it is not even faster than the one of  the old trains. Honestly,  all I want
is to have a peaceful nap before I open my eyes for good, to know that my train
is going to be there on time and a system that can actually track the arrival
time of the buses (and that's a whole other story).

*I mean this primarily in terms of development/future usefulness!*  My answer
would be Sullivan Square, as it is located adjacent to a relatively medium-dense
neighborhood, close-enough to Charlestown, and is located near a couple of good
job centers–notably Schrafft's and Hood Park. I know there are future plans to
reconfigure Sullivan Square itself, with (hopefully!) more mixed-use development
and park space. In addition to its status as a busy bus hub already, I think it
has a lot of potential to carry much more traffic as a true MBTA modal hub. As
of now, though, there are a few problems with it.  1. It's under a highway. This
is mostly not fixable lol  2. There is no direct connection to the adjacent
neighborhood, which is crazy  3. Sullivan Square itself is a horrible place to
walk/bike (as I personally know having been there many times)  But again, with
the future reconfiguration, alongside maybe a Commuter Rail infill, it has a lot
of potential! I'm curious what your pick is for the station with the most
potential?

A lot of the orange line stock have severe wheel flats and it doesn’t seem like
a big enough priority to fix them.  To help raise awareness, here are just some
of the reasons why these are bad.  1. It’s a horrible ride for the riders.
Nobody wants to ride in a train that’s loud and bumpy the whole way. This makes
passengers feel unsafe and it gives the impression that our system is in
disrepair.  2. For surrounding neighborhoods, wheel flats make trains MUCH
louder than they would otherwise be. I live about half a mile from the tracks
and can still hear the slamming of wheel against rails occasionally.  3.
Probably most importantly, wheel flats are HORRIBLE for the tracks. If left
unchecked, these wheel flats are going to create dents in the tracks themselves
and lead to delays, speed restrictions, and line closures in the future.  Please
help me in spreading the cause and let me know of any good ways I can contact
the MBTA management with this information.

of this and report it, we pull into Quincy center, no PD in sight. The doors
close on QC and the teens start fighting each other, I report that to the app as
well. We pull into Quincy Adams and this all spills out on to the platform, a
teen is literally getting stomped out by several other teens. Kids are calling
911. I’m STILL reporting this to the app. ONE transit cop pulls up with a T
ambassador and another T employee and they detain TWO of the kids. The rest get
back on the train and CONTINUE fighting all the way to Braintree. At Braintree
there’s around 5-10 transit cops waiting AT THE WRONG END OF THE PLATFORM. The
fighting continues out into the garage and of course all the officers are inside
still. Genuinely confused as to why we have transit police or the see/say app if
they’re both so useless! This wasn’t a quick situation either, from the first
report to me leaving Braintree station was a half hour.   Edit: to be fair the
app DID work correctly, the police however did not

Hello, dear riders!  I am an 18M year old psychology student at UMass Boston and
I am really interested in how we got to the situation that the T is in.
Obviously the major issue is the lack of funding from cities and the state as a
whole and horrible leadership that failed to address the issues that the system
is experiencing. Even now, with all of the improvements we have seen in terms of
faster trains on the Red and Green Lines, the T still has a gauntlet of problems
that needs to be dealt before the system is in a good state of repairs.  The Big
Dig is another major issue since the state basically stole millions of dollars
from the T for a program that has not been able to address the increasing demand
of traffic.  However, if I was head of the T, here is what I would plan for the
next couple of years, based on lines:  RED LINE: - Accelerate the deployment of
the new CRRC trains that has been waited on for a decade. All of the trains were
supposed to be implemented in 2023 yet we have seen continuous delays due to
Cabot Yard work that should’ve been done while the cars were deployed. -
Renovate old stations (Shawmut, UMass, Andrew, Broadway, etc) to keep them up to
date. - Improve outbound train departures so that riders do not have to wait for
an Ashmont or Braintreee train for up to 20-25 minutes or for Alewife trains to
come every 15 minutes on the Ashmont/Braintree branches.  GREEN LINE: - Order
more Type 9 trains and wait to implement Type 10s until the near future so that
trains are updated while waiting to accommodate the needed changes to use the
Type 10 trains. - Consolidate stations on the B, C, and E branches so that
trains are not stopping every 2 minutes like a bus and so stations are actually
being used. - Make stations on the E branch accessible past Brigham Circle so
that passengers do not have to cross traffic to access trains + separate the
trains from incoming traffic. - Implement priority signals for trains so that
they do not have to wait for traffic (like how LA Metro does theirs). - Renovate
Hynes, Symphony, etc.  ORANGE LINES - Fix the slow zone between Sullivan and
BHCC. - Renovate stations past Back Bay (many are starting to show their time
and are extremely ugly/outdated or possibly dangerous) - Extend to Melrose and
Roslindale/W. Roxbury while trying to not raise property prices in the area
(which would inevitably happen).  BLUE LINE: - Make new trains for the Blue Line
to keep them up to date. - Renovate stations Suffolk Downs up to Revere Beach. -
Extend the Blue Line to Lynn while finding ways to maintain property prices. -
Extend the line westward if time and money permits.  SILVER LINE -Make this a
radial line so that downtown stations are not packed during rush hours (State,
PS, GC, and DC). - Make this a subway line to reestablish transit to Nubian,
Everett, and City Point. - Use old Blue Line trains while planning new trains.
SYSTEMWIDE - Pay your employees more so that you can get more people to work the
system. - Community oversight so that the region can know that the T is using
their funds correctly and are being truthful. - Expand board of directors to
include the elderly, students, etc so that everyone is represented in major
decision. - ASK FOR MORE FUNDING FROM THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO
IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED! - Do more to protect workers (since we
are being monitored by the FTA yet still having near-death situations that
should not be happening).  CR (REGIONAL RAIL) - Electrify the system. - Extend
the D line to Auburndale to have immediate access to the CR station. - Place a
CR station at Medford/Tufts so that GLX riders do not have to go to N. Station
just to go back where they came from. - Renovate all stations that need it to
maintain a good state of repair.

Hello friends. I’m assuming there’s someone here who knows things I don’t know.
Obviously the reduction in headways has a lot to do with train speed from the
slow zones. However IIRC the original reduction occurred due to the FTA order
since there weren’t enough dispatchers to run that many trains. Does anyone know
if there has been progress here? Em  IMO, the biggest issue with the T as an
everyday system these days is the slow headways. 9-10 min between trains
compounds all other issues horribly because if one thing goes wrong, your entire
itinerary is fucked.   Thanks for the info in advance!

curfew. If greyhound was on time my 8 PM bus would have gotten me to south
Station with plenty of time.  However my greyhound is running 1 hour late and
getting worse by the minute. So taking the bus has now become an unviable
option. As I write this I am in a Uber from Springfield ( cost 90 usd I want to

time and I don’t get kicked out of my program. I will update but the moral of

train end! Hate stuff like this. I met some strangers who were equally as

only positive is it’s still possible to go from the street end to the train by
going up to the 2nd floor and back down, but that feels like a little bit of a

If anyone here is like me and lives in Boston that sees how crazy the traffic is
around here each and everyday no matter where you go, it gets you to pondering
on moving to a better area in the city of Boston where transit is above and
beyond what the city is giving.  if you look at the overall transit resiliency
of chelsea, their bus Routes 111, 104, 116 along with the orange and blue lines
have the most accurate of timing for frequency getting people around all day and
night long.   meanwhile here in Boston, they just don't care all that much about
getting people around on a timed basis so they can make grocery trips, medical
appointments and enjoy doing other things like they do up in Chelsea.   I mean,
if i have to leave my apartment 2-3 hours ahead of time just to make where i'm
going in Boston? knowing your not getting that time you wasted back, then its
time to get out and find somewhere else with better access to actual reliant
transportation.   I mean, with delay after delay with the trains and buses
causing even LONGER delays. I'm considering leaving and becoming part of a city
where I can commute and get around better.  Traffic is at an all time high
that's worse now than it was 20 years ago.   Who else feels the same way?   I
hate to sound like a downer about traveling by MBTA here but we all know it's
true.

I’m guessing no but thought I’d ask.   I didn’t have time to wait an hour for
the next train to arrive so I gave them more money and took the green line.   I
hate that you have to scan to get into the commuter rail area at North Station

Title: Why I Hate the CRRC Trains: A Motorman's Perspective

Post ID: 1i1qxup

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I thought you guys might find this interesting. Here's a list of all the reasons
why I, as a Red Line Motorman, hate the CRRC trains.   In no particular order:
- The passenger seats are uncomfortable. - Not enough seating in the cars, tons
of open space. I know we're trying for accessibility but I feel like it's too
much. What about people who are elderly or injured who need a seat? - The GMD
button is SUPER easy to accidentally press. It happens constantly, and every
single time it does, the motorman has to walk back to that car to make sure no
one needs assistance. - The GMD is a completely useless feature. It doesn't take
the platform's elevation into account, just sticks straight out. It is also
EXTREMELY slow to deploy and only functions in the head car. It is literally
faster and more useful to get a bridgeplate in every situation imaginable.  -
The software behind the destination signs have no functionality to input
anything other than terminus stations. This is extremely confusing for
passengers during diversions.  - The automatic announcements always say the
doors will open on "the left, or right" when coming into Alewife or Braintree.
I, as the motorman, know which side the doors will open on well before we enter
the station because I can see how the switch is set. There is a button on the
announcement interface to pick which side it says the doors will open on. That
button does nothing.  - There is an error with the automatic announcements that
pops up sometimes that also prevents me from using the PA to make manual
announcements. So when that happens, we just have no announcements I guess. -
There are a million false and redundant error codes that show up on the MTU,
which obfuscates the important ones.  - The doors are extremely slow to close. -
THE BEEPING. THE ENDLESS BEEPING. DEAR GOD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP. - You can't use
"the slide" to berth at stations- the train will harshly jolt and dump its air.
No fun at all. -  The tinted windows in the motorman's cab block the ability to
utilize the station mirrors if you didn't stop in the EXACT right spot. They
also dampen my beautiful skyline view on the Longfellow bridge.  - The
windshield wipers are positioned in a really annoying spot that partially blocks
my view of the track. And they don't even wipe the whole windshield, only like
1/3rd of it. - The coat hook is positioned right in front of the cab door, so if
I hang my coat or bag there I literally can't open the door without moving it. -
The hostler car significantly reduces redundancy for when there are inevitable
mechanical failures. -  When doing an emergency stop at 40mph, the wheels go
flat.  - The circuit breaker panel is locked with a maintenance key that
motormen are not issued. So I literally can't reset anything on this train. This
is something motormen are expected to do when problems arise, and they actually
prevented us from being able to do it. Genius.   I'm probably forgetting some,
I'll edit this post if I can think of more. These trains REALLY suck. Even so,
more new trains can't come fast enough- it is absolutely deplorable that we're
running multiple trains with out-of-service cars DURING RUSH HOUR because we
have no functional equipment. I'll take what I can get, damn it.  Edit to add
more stuff, in case anyone's still reading this: - The ledge you use to climb on
the front of the train is EXTREMELY narrow. It is legitimately scary- and I say
this as a small person with small feet. - The train is filled to the brim with
cameras, including one on the rear of the train for backing up, with a viewing
screen in the cab. Great idea! Except there is no way to interface with the
screen, so I can't pull up my 5th car to check a report of someone smoking in
there, or pull up the rearview camera if I overshoot the station. The screen
just cycles through all the cameras uselessly. - The headlights are a circle of
LED bulbs, and for low beams the bottom half lights up, and for high beams the
top half lights up. This design makes it so that the low beams don't show you
enough distance, and the high beams are at a weird useless angle and aren't any
brighter than the low beams. - The pilot lights being grouped in pairs make them
extremely difficult to discern when berthed on platforms that lack a generous
curve- they blend together.  *All opinions shared are solely my own. I do not
speak for or represent the MBTA in any way.*

I have the new reduced fare card and wanted to load it with the monthly pass
that includes the express bus. Went to a ticket machine inside Back Bay station
and selected the corresponding option. Got charged the $67 and the machine gave
me a ticket. I've asked an MBTA worker on the Orange Line if they knew what was
up with that. They told me I should ask at the MBTA Service Desk if it's
possible to just use the plastic reduced fare card as opposed to the ticket.
Does anyone know anything about this? Would hate to travel all the way there to
find out I just have to keep using the paper ticket for a whole month. I don't
really mind it but I don't understand the point of having the plastic card then.
And also just worried that the ticket will start falling apart. Based on the
info on the website, it's also unclear if the ticket is given to be used for the
ferry/commuter rail, and if I can indeed use the plastic card for everything
else?  Would really appreciate any help! Thanks!

Lately, there's been a lot of talk about the South Coast Rail service, which is
set to open in Spring 2025.   Would anyone ride this same kind of service if the
Commuter rail built it between South Station and Provincetown? I know the Cape
Flyer gets a lot of passengers, but currently it is only a once per day, weekend
service. On top of that, it's Eastern terminus is Hyannis, which is only about
halfway down the cape. Let's suppose the T decided to build a new set of tracks
to Provincetown. Let's suppose they also built a second set of tracks from
Plymouth to Borne so that they didn't have to take the long way around through
the Lakeville/Middleborough line.  Would any of you guys ride this? I know
people who live on the Cape would. Granted, the Cape has nowhere near as many
people as the South Coast, but I recon the service would still sell some
tickets. A lot of day-cationers hate traffic going to and from the cape. Cape
Cod Regional Transit Authority could run busses to and from Nauset beach and a
potential Orleans Commuter Rail Station. Last but not least, Provincetown's
Historic District has a lot of walkable-pre automobile bones, so many people
wouldn't even need cars once they got there.

Just heard the n-word being said repeatedly on the red line (train 01823)… Has
anyone else had an experience like this?  I’m in genuine shock about it. Could
they have gotten hacked? Was it someone operating the train? Either case is
concerning…  To be more specific, the guy on the speakers would say “I hate
n-words!”, repeat the n-word a bunch of times, and then repeat that sequence.
Shit was absolutely absurd. Fuck that guy!

anyone else had this experience? Do they eventually send the rest? I just hate
using the app to pay and I prefer the invoices to come per month, but I don't
want to receive a bill this month that's for all of the extra June dates on top
of all of the July dates.  Let me know if any of you have experience with this,

this argument even though it was a bitch fight. Middleton isnt serviced by
transit for MBTA but they essentially rejected funding for all future works
including a new roof for our school. Middleton just dropped a bomb on the other
towns we share a high school with. Ps. If you watch the meeting Im the kid in

Hello everyone,   I am grad student applying for jobs/co-ops.I live with my
parents in the suburbs and will likely have a longgg commute for my job, as most
are in the Boston/Cambridge area. About 90 minutes, taking the commuter rail and
the urban line because I hate driving in general but especially into the city.
I'm trying to figure out how I can be the most efficient with my long commute so
I don't have to be up too early. I am naturally slow as hell in the AM so this
will be a challenge. One thing I am thinking is to eat breakfast while I wait
for the train.   However, I function best with caffeine, but I don't like the
idea of slamming a big coffee and then starting a long commute ( it is an
express train, so it's only about 40 minutes, but still)...for, you know,
bathroom reasons...  I like the idea of eating before I get on the train, and
having my coffee during the train ride. I know technically you aren't supposed
to do that, but I do take the cr for school and I seem to notice everyone
eating/drinking as they please, as long as they are discreet.   Anyone have
experience with this? It just seems so absurd to have a long commute and not be
allowed to eart/drink on the train.   Thanks,  Mei\_Flower1996  &amp;#x200B;

Everything I'm proposing is disregarding political or beurocratic obstacles.
Could the rail link be constructed as shown above? My thought process is that
the reserve bank building is far enough right there is room to run the tracks
past it (with measures to assure foundational stability) and all that would be
taken out would be a parking lot. Additionally, since there was previously a
track running underneath the main concourse, it is clearly possible for the
platforms to be lower. It would require a rebuild of south station similar to
the one in 1989, which would be very expensive yes, but I think considering the
current plan to tunnel bore several very long, deep tunnels along the harbor
this is well within reason. The entire length of this project up to North
Washington Street would be cut and cover, significantly reducing costs. At North
Washington Street the tunnel would go beneath government center parking garage
(not sure if a new building is being built there but it's a very short distance
regardless) and then cut and cover won't canal Street to connect it to north
station. (Second picture)  All this would allow every commuter rail line to be a
through line, connecting directly to North, central, and South station with no
deep stations that are difficult to access, it's proximity to the surface also
means that vents would be much cheaper to build so diesels could be run through
the link thus allowing us to create commuter rail without needing to buy hybrid
engines (I hate hybrid engines, I'm willing to argue about it)  All of this is
based on one massive assumption of mine: we are able to repair Boston by finally
tearing down the central artery, or SIGNIFICANTLY downsize it, (it would
theoretically be possible to still have 1 Lane each direction underground by the
tracks)   Finally, I acknowledge that this would look like a second big to a lot
of people, and to that I say that the big dig was a crap project to hide a
mistake, and this is a huge step forward to truly fix our city.  Sorry for the
long post lol, hope you like my idea ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡

the Orange Line into the city. I've done it loads of time, but I've never
actually looked to see if Oak Grove has an elevator that connects to the train
platform. I know there are elevators that go from the parking lot to the
lobby/train gates, but I can't find anything on the MBTA's site that specifies
whether or not there is an elevator back down to the platform.   Thanks in

Today, an adult black man wearing a red hat and an elderly white lady exchanged
some harsh words and insults. He kept calling her wrinkles, talking about his
gun and how drunk he is, and she kept saying she’s going to kick his ass,
threatening to hit him with her magazine, as well as trying to strike up a
conversation with me about how she hates “these people” - classism? racism?both?
🤔  I kept reiterating that I’m really not trying to get involved. It wasn’t a
safe space for me to have a conversation with her to find out her prejudices. In
my head I’m just wondering, does he indeed have a gun? I don’t want to find out.
I also don’t want this lady to start a fight with me. I thought about getting
off the bus and walking the rest of the way to work, but I’d be very late.
Operator 65835 (same person who had to deal with the Smile of the Child lady)
politely asked him to stop, and other riders also tried to intervene (thank
you!) but it seems like he started picking fights with them too and suggesting
violence. He finally got off the bus as Mass Ave.   Anyways, it would be great
to ride the bus feeling physically and psychologically safe again soon.

The red line keeps getting worse and so do the buses.   Now the 16 bus has no
schedule just because of a weekend detour.  I do not understand how every train
and all the busses are late. What is the point of a schedule? I left this
morning in time for at least two buses to get me to Andrew on time and avoid all
the fucking kids. Neither showed up. Then the bus is so packed and stops at
EVERY stop no matter what. What was 20-25 min is now 45. They took away the
commuter rail option - which also sucked in its own way. I can never make it to
the 8a 238 (THE ONLY ON TIME BUS - ONE WAY) no matter when I leave and I refuse
to have a 2 hour commute (which is mostly just waiting) for what amounts to a 20
min drive. No matter what time I get to Andrew the next Braintree train is
15-20m away. 40m from JFK to Quincy Center. Uber and Lyft were charging $30 this
morning for a 10 min ride from the train station.   The T should be free if it
is going to continue to suck ass. It should in no way expect anyone to want to
pay for services that I'm sure are not actually being fixed. This time next year
- it will probably be worse. This winter will suck as usual since it seems to
surprise the whole city despite being in the NE.

On Monday, I was in Quincy looking at some new cars at the car dealership like
the Ford F150 Lightning and the Nissan Ariya. Afterwards, I decided to return
home to Cambridge via the MBTA. Due to me missing the northbound train to
Alewife (I was just about to enter the gate when the train doors finally closed
and the train left without me), I had to wait another 35 minutes for the next
Alewife train to come. Instead of waiting 35 minutes, I decided to take the
commuter rail to South Station (I only had to wait 10 minutes for that to come)
and ended up going all the way to South Station.  Because I carry my folding
bike with me, it is tedious to carry it up and down the stairs given it takes
longer than just using the elevator (even though I am a relatively strong and
muscular man), so I used the elevator. Knowing that the Alewife train is coming,
I started to approach the elevator when the elevator closed. I basically pressed
the down button and the elevator opened, and when the elevator/lift opened,
there was a white middle-aged woman who was extremely pissed and even though
there are no social distancing policies and she wasn't wearing a mask, she
stated that she did not want to go in the elevator with me and instead, exited
the elevator and instead, used the stairs. Once I got down to the northbound
platform, she (the middle-aged white woman with a pink coat) told me that I am
under arrest even though there are no police officers chasing down me. Before, I
thought she is going to assault me, so I tried to run away from her as fast as I
can whilst carrying the bike with me. But due to the fact there are a lot of
people waiting for the Red Line Train, going as fast as possible isn't very
possible and therefore, I was stuck with her harassing me. I didn't know what to
do and I was so scared that if I recorded the incident on TikTok, something bad
might happen to me (I might get assaulted, which might ruin my day, so I let the
event be)  Now I do have to note that I am an Asian American by the way who was
born in Vietnam in 2001 and moved to Boston in 2012 as an international student
before becoming a US citizen in 2021.  After I left the train, I decided to ask
MBTA staff for advice on whether or not this incident is harassing or not or if
this woman is mad at me for using the elevator along with her even though there
are no social distancing policies being enforced. They told me to report this
incident to the MBTA police. For me, I decided not to report since I wanted to
let the event go due to the fact that I might not see her. What are your
opinions on this incident and is there anyway to report this incident given that
I have no videographic evidence?   There had been incidents where some so-called
'Karens' refused to share elevator with certain people, but I am not certain if
this category fits, because first off, only she was in the elevator and she is
carrying nothing, and plus, the elevator is relatively big, meaning it could fit
her as well as my bike and I with no problems.  The reason why I didn't take
action and record a footage is because I was worried that I might get assaulted
by her and I wasn't sure what to do at the point due to me not wanting to be
assaulted and cause a fight. I am curious if there are any cameras installed at
the South Station elevators (I meant the one near the South Station entrance)? I
do know sometimes, there are certain people peeing at train stations and stuff.

I’m an undergraduate student at UMass Boston and I take the Commuter Rail, and
the limited service at JFK/UMass is stupid and outdated. The spring/summer
schedule states that inbound service for JFK ends at 10 AM and outbound doesn’t
start until 2 PM. A four-hour gap is actually insane. It sucks for those who
only have one class like me on select days, and I have to wait until 2 just to
go home. My theory is that they’re broke and want to tax the hell out of people
using the Red Line so that’s why they limited service at JFK/UMass. But it’s
college season now and the schedule needs to be updated because it’s straight up
stupidity.

I feel like this should be brought up to whoever writes the schedules out. I
honestly found the CR to be more reliable with the schedules then than now.
There was more rush hour and late night service in both directions, and yes,
there were less trains during the day but there also aren't many people riding
at that hour between (9:45-2:15). Rush hour service was outstanding (30ish
minutes on all lines) and, aside from the Old Colony and Stoughton lines, trains
ran up to 15 minutes past midnight (good for game and event nights). Obviously
this wouldn't apply to the Fall River and New Bedford lines but would be ideal
for the other lines as it would allow the process of adding trains to the
schedules a bit easier. There were the same amount of weekday trains daily on
almost all the lines so it wouldn't make the staff issue that much worse. Also,
lines with single track issues were still timed to not interfere with each other
as they are now. I feel like this would be good for most of the lines. I might
be the only one but does anyone else think so?  P.S. They would keep the weekend
schedules they have now with the last trains leaving a little after midnight (no
later than 12:15am) as the weekend schedules kinda sucked then. Also they would
use them for storm service instead of taking important weekday trains off the
schedules.  P.P.S. The Fairmount, South Coast Rail, and parts of the Providence
and Worcester lines would keep the current schedule while others would all be
changed back to their 2019 schedules.

I personally think it looks nice. The text for all non-terminal stops could be
slightly larger to help those who may not have good vision (also no braille,

Lechmere, which other maps did not do well.   Also, apparently, the Wayfinding

Hello! First time long time.   There is a conductor on the Newburyport line,
train #18, who handles the two rear cars most mornings. And she kind of sucks.
She berates customers so much so that she legitimately scares my wife on
occasion.   I understand the need to speed up train boarding, but I've never
seen a conductor yell at passengers for preferring a modern Hyundai Rotem vs a
CTC-1B. And then take up a fold-down priority seat with her purse!   I'm a
paying customer. Why am I being yelled at?   Has anybody else encountered this
conductor? I don't know their name or badge. How do I complain about her without
any identifying info? I'm tired of this and I've heard Keolis doesn't mess with
this stuff.  Many thanks, all.

Title: MBTA doesn't offer CharlieCard refunds

We'll they do, but it's nearly impossible.  I purchased a monthly pass for my
wife and I, total $180. It didn't work, so I assumed the transaction failed.
However, I checked my credit card today and I really was charged $180. So I went
to the CharlieCard store downtown thinking I'd be able to get a refund.  Turns
out the CharlieCard card store can't process refunds (what's the point of the
store?? lol). They let me know I had to call a customer service number. So I did
that, and learned that in order to process the refund, you have to know the
kiosk number, and the exact time you attempted the purchase. This was a few days
ago, and I couldn't remember the exact time the purchase was made, so I said
just have them check 8am to 8pm. They politely let me know that a refund is
impossible because  "this is Boston, do you know how many transactions are on
that machine each day? it would be impossible for them to search through that
many transactions"  I tried to explain the concept of ctrl+f but they weren't
entertained. Tried calling a few times to verify, but ya they really need the
exact time. That and I had tried multiple kiosks to make the transaction that
day, and the customer service lady almost lost their mind at the idea of having
to check multiple machines. Anyhow it sucks I'm out $180. Really looking forward
to the T modernizing their pay kiosks....

I’m sorry, but why does the green line from Medford/Tufts SUCK?? Like royally.
Every morning during rush hour, it always seems to stall, stand, and wait due to
signaling problems or unknown reasons. This typically occurs at stops before
North Station.   Today, just getting to Science Park from Medford/Tufts at
around 8:30 am, the train was stalled for over 20 minutes cumulatively. The
entire ride from Medford/Tufts to Science Park should only be 15 minutes - not
35!   I am debating moving to Medford/Somerville since it’s close to my friends
but I need to commute to Longwood every day. Just had to get that off my
chest….Any advice?

Title: Something needs to be done about Haunted Happenings bus delays

Author: 420MenshevikIt (ID: t2_esnba)

Post ID: 1gh62zx

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The past couple weeks, riding the 450 bus has been absolutely brutal. Haunted
Happenings crowds and events mean that the bus get severely delayed on the
northern end of the route, between Salem Hospital and Salem Depot. These delays
then radiate down to everyone else who uses the line in Lynn, Revere and Boston.
It's already a very delay-prone route, but the lateness has gotten completely
out of hand as of the past few weeks. I don't think I took a 450 bus this month
that was less than 15 minutes late. Several were 25 minutes late. It gets so
late that I leave the house for the bus stop factoring in the delay I
anticipate, and then still end up waiting 10+ minutes at the bus stop because of
how badly it crawls, especially on Essex St.   A few days ago I watched on a
tracker as an outbound 450 bus took more than five minutes to make it through
the final ~400 feet of Essex St to the North/Summer intersection. A person in a
cast using crutches could have walked that same distance two or three times and
still beaten the bus. People in Lynn and Revere can't ride that bus inbound
until it finishes running outbound. By the time I got on that bus inbound it was
running more than 25 minutes late. A lot of people in Lynn use the bus for trips
within Lynn and a lot of those people have no other option than to ride the bus.
It happens with the other routes with segments in Salem, 435 and 455 as well of
course. Lots of 15-20+ minute delayed 435 buses the past couple weeks. It's just
my bad experiences have mostly involved route 450 so that's my focus.   I know
it's a tough problem to solve, but they need to be trying something during
October to alleviate this. Whatever they're doing now is NOT working. The
problems this October have been really exasperating, it isn't acceptable. I love
that Haunted Happenings brings a lot of tourism money to the area, but it really
sucks that people in surrounding - poorer - cities are getting raked over the
coals by overtourism that isn't even ours. I don't like being an externality.The
ridership on this route doesn't even seem to go up much during October and it
doesn't seem like tourists use it (and why would they with the train right
there?) so it's not simply a delays due to increased ridership thing like one
might think.   I don't know what would or wouldn't work in the slightest...but
some thoughts I had were: shortening the route to the southern edge of downtown
Salem for October instead of keeping service to Salem Depot; having much longer
layovers after an outbound run so that prior bus can start the inbound trip on
time regardless of how delayed the outbound bus is getting; Temporary bus lanes
in Salem to keep things moving?  also slightly related... I think there should
be another bus schedule timepoint on the 450 bus somewhere between Salem Depot
and West Lynn Garage. It's a really long route with highly unpredictable
traffic. That unpredictable traffic means the schedule is padded for traffic. If
the bus doesn't hit that traffic it starts running early. They shouldn't be
running several minutes early all the way through Lynn and then holding for a
few minutes at West Lynn Garage, but on days where that bus got lucky and hit
little traffic, it sure does that. AFAIK MBTA buses are only required to not
depart a stop early at the stops with times given in the paper schedule. They
should add one of those time points somewhere in between Salem Depot and West
Lynn Garage. I think it would also reflect more accurately on just how
frequently delayed the bus gets through Lynn (AFAIK a bus only counts as 'late'
based on the stops with times listed in the schedule.. running late between them
doesn't unless it's still late at the next listed stop).

So I'm heading home and get on the train, full of people. I am trying to get to
the next car to see if I can get a seat and there is a guy in front of me. I
walk toward him giving way to the right side so we can squeeze by each other and
he starts shaking his head no, and positions his shoulder bag on his chest
looking like a battering ram. He doesn't go back and I'm not gonna turn around
and walk the other way because that seems dumb and since he doesn't want to give
way he should do it. So I start passing on the right  because i dont want to
stand if i dont have to and he's not giving any space, then as I'm like 90%
passed him he give me what I can only call a butt shove into an arm rest. I say
somethimg like 'wtf is your problem man' and he doesn't respond, which was
probably for the best for everyone, and i head to the next car. I get ready to
get off at my stop and pass by him and motion to him like "are we good here?"
And he waves so I said sorry and gave him a fist bump.  He's probably a fine
guy, maybe it was just wrong place wrong time, egos for not wanting to gove way,
but am I in the wrong here? I have gone butt to butt trying to get passed people
for years and never had that happen. Yeah it sucks, it's crowded, nobody wants
to be close to anybody but I've always viewed this as part of the deal.

I’m sure the days are numbered for these FVMs, but they were bane of my
existence sometimes. Maybe this is an edge case, but the T and its vendor never
consistently sent debit cards over credit “payment rails” when credit was
selected at the FVMs. This was a problem because some tax-advantaged transit
debit cards for a long time did not have user-selectable PINs. I get that it’s a
local vendor, and we didn’t have the technology we have now, but man these

a train you pay nearly an equivalent of what we do on the MBTA and seeing
full-out cushioned chairs and seats you could shift around manually to make

Just why? What makes it so difficult for Massachusetts to have comfortable,
lovely trains like this. Then it hit me. People. We have time and time again,
ripped seats, left trash all over the ground and more. While many people in
Boston are respectful and would never do it, Japan has nearly zero people who
would do the vandalization needed to make their train administration say 'Fuck

get the trains to run promptly? It's miserable to deal with but it is possible
as the control comes from the service itself. However the internal respect of
the trains makes these kinds of luxury-looking subway cars a pipe dream at this

So I’m seeing that I won’t be able to use my Perq/Charlie card on the commuter

there a way to pay the difference from 1A to 1 on my Perq card rather than
getting a separate zone 1 CR ticket? I know the zone 1A works for subway and
buses and is the same price as a Perq card for subway ($90 a month), so
shouldn’t there be a way to just add a bit more money for zone 1 rather than
having to pay full price on a separate ticket?  Related, for those that took the
CR prior to the Charlie Card deal, how often would they check tickets?
Throughout the summer, taking the CR roundtrip daily, I’ve only had to show a
ticket/Charlie card 4 times. If that continues, I could afford to just pay for 1
off tickets when they actually check.

Hi all you MBTA folks. This is a reminder that the MBTA is facing a financial
cliff **very** soon. Starting next year, the agency will be facing a &gt;$400
million operating budget deficit **per year**. The only reason that didn't
happen this year is because they tapped emergency funds
([source](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/06/09/metro/mbta-facing-grave-financial-crisis-puts-off-fiscal-cliff-another-year-using-one-time-federal-funds/)).
Think the service sucks now? Just wait until they have to save $400 million
every year. We need to remind our representatives that we want to see increased
funding to avoid this.  Have you written to your state Rep and Senator to demand
more funding? Have you written to the Governor? Even if you have already, I
think it bears repeating. Don't you? Make it a regular thing. Sending an email
takes a few minutes. Sending a physical letter would be even better. Links to

Just posted this to Facebook:  We need electrified regional rail in
Massachusetts. This should be a pretty high priority if you are an
environmentalist.   I’m in Philadelphia right now, riding the SEPTA Regional
rail network. This 27 minute train trip will save me ~30 minutes and a ton of
aggravation compared to driving.   Massachusetts operates a Commuter Rail
network in and around Boston. Philadelphia operates a Regional Rail network. The
difference is very important.   A commuter rail network is exclusively meant for
commuters, in and out of the downtown core. You live in the suburbs and work
downtown. Trains are timed to go inbound in the morning, and back to the suburbs
in the afternoon. There is minimal service outside of these times, such as
evenings and midday. This means that the rail network can be useful if you are a
suburbanite, but unlikely to be used any other time.   A regional rail network
is one that is meant to provide decent all-day service, late into the evening.
My specific SEPTA line provides hourly or better service all day, until ~10:30
PM on weekdays. This is in addition to trains every ~20 minutes during peak
hours. I use these trains to visit friends in the suburbs while I am staying
downtown, as well as to commute in last year. This regional rail style service
makes many trips possible that just aren’t with a commuter-only network.  Using
a rail network just for commuters doesn’t make financial sense. Think about it -
the most expensive part of a network is the rails and rolling stock (train cars
and engines). Trains and tracks cost roughly the same amount to maintain,
regardless of whether they are used ten or 100 times a day. If you are letting
all these resources sit idle all day and night, you are wasting money and
encouraging people to drive everywhere!  Diesel trains also kind of suck.
They’re power limited, and therefore slow. They have to carry a diesel generator
on board, making them heavy. They can only produce at most 4,200 horsepower (GE
Genesis P42DC used by Amtrak). They need lots of maintenance, make tons of
noise, smell bad, and pollute pretty badly for a train (not in comparison to
each rider driving, though).   An electric locomotive can produce well over
8,000 horsepower (MARC HHP-8) because it does not need to carry a diesel
generator. They can accelerate much faster (especially electric multiple units
(EMUs)) and hit higher top speeds (125mph or higher). Additionally, they don’t
smell and are almost silent! Plus, operating costs are much lower. There’s far
less maintenance and no diesel fuel needed. They are the cleanest, most green
form of transportation available to humans besides bicycling or walking.   Even
if you’re a driver, you should want more trains! They take other cars off the
road, making YOUR commute by car faster and more efficient, and making parking
easier at your destination. This also means that fewer aggravating road
construction widening projects need to happen! It’s a win-win.   There are
several plans in the MA state legislature for various portions of commuter rail
electrification and conversion to regional rail. Call your reps and tell them
you want this, especially if you’re in central/eastern countries. I would love
to see MA have a fast, clean, fully electric regional rail network in my
lifetime - and the only way that happens is if the people make some NOISE.

&amp;#x200B;  # Some highlights:  * The Orange Line has **25% MORE service on
Sundays**. (Going from 8 to 10 train sets in service). * Saturday service on the
Orange Line is **slightly increased.** * The Blue Line is getting **small**
weekend service cuts. * The Blue Line is getting **large weekday off-peak
service increases.** * The Green Line is getting **minor service cuts.**
&amp;#x200B;  # A few notes to dispel confusion:  * While it looks like the Red
Line has had service cuts (less frequency), this is NOT the case. The Red Line
schedule actually did not change, the MBTA is just resetting expectations. The
reason for this is that the MBTA could not meet their intended March schedule
due to slow zones.  * While it looks like the Orange has had **WEEKDAY** service
cuts (less frequency), this is NOT the case. The Orange Line is actually getting
**MORE** frequency, with an eleventh train set going into regularly scheduled
service. The reason that it looks like there is less frequency is because the
MBTA could not meet their March schedule because of slow zones. **With 11 train
sets** in service, the **MBTA might actually exceed their intended weekday
schedule**. Only time will tell. * Yes, the Red Line currently sucks. Feel free
to complain and vent about it **somewhere else.** I'm guessing that the main
reason that the Red Line cannot get more service is because the slow zones on
the Alewife crossover are creating a severe bottleneck.  &amp;#x200B;  If you
have any questions, I will try and answer them.

Today I'm checking off a piece of my Boston Bucket List and working my way to
Ashmont to take the Mattapan Trolley.  However, my timing sucks and I just
missed the Ashmont bound train out of Alewife.  So, do I wait for 20 minutes
here at Alewife, or do I hop on the Braintree train and then later on kill some
time in a station before JFK/UMass?  I ride the Redline for my commute all the
time but rarely go south of South Station. I have a monthly pass right now so
popping in and out of the system isn't a problem.  I'm thinking of just
wandering around Downtown Crossing or Park Street areas. Maybe grab a coffee or
snack at the Roche Bros at Downtown Crossing before hoping back in the Ashmont
bound train.   Thoughts from this group of MBTA experts?  Thanks all, and wish
me good luck!  Edit: got the station for the Roche Bros mixed up, fixed!

The blue line on the CTA in Chicago (the one that goes to O’Hare) only runs
every 15 minutes on Saturday and this one was 6 minutes late to leave on top ot
that.   (at least the CTA dealt with its slow zone hell several years back.)  I
was in NYC last weekend and my entire MTA experience was great, so that’s a plus
I guess.

Took a trip on the union square branch today - talk about the pits.  Outbound -
delay of 5+ minutes at the 'union square' just North of Lechmere.   Driver
eventually had to get out and do something manually.     Then another few
minutes at the US crossover, as the station was full and we had to wait for
someone to leave.  Back inbound - apparently the ticket machines don't validate
anymore.   One had no paper, the other the 'validate' option was grey after
scanning my monthly pass.  Then we sat at the 'Lechmere/yard' switch for a few
minutes again - no clue why - had been 10-odd minutes since the last train left
before me.  Then more delay at the top of the ramp before Lechmere.     (No
announcements for any of these delays either).  &amp;#x200B;  Is this SOP or did
I hit a special morning?

I know the actual answer is something to the effect of "because the T sucks and
is underfunded and poorly managed," but is there an *acute* reason the Red Line
has been moving much more slowly than usual for the past 2-3 weeks?  Lately it
feels like the trains have literally been crawling along the tracks, especially
south of the city, and they also frequently stop at stations for 5-10 minutes
for no reason. I always check Twitter when this happens to make sure there
aren't any delays but there aren't ever any posted.   The commute from Quincy to
Cambridge has gone from 31 minutes a few months ago to 45 minutes now.

Right now the fare gates are open at Back Bay, Copley, Wellington, and North
Station for the Orange Line work. You can also enter the system on the SL1 at
the Airport for free. Will operators on Green/SL2/SL3 block people from boarding
who want to pay with CharleCard stored value or with cash in the frequent cases
the farebox is broken?  If the T is going to have fare evasion citations they
can't also have porous fare system. Vibes-baed enforcement won't cut it.

It’s honestly inspiring to see more and more people finally waking up to the
truth about Eng — the man is basically a legend in our time. The  posts praising
his leadership just shows how deeply his vision has taken root. I wouldn’t be
surprised if it’s loyal employees, grateful riders, and everyday citizens all
creating accounts just to spread the good word, wouldn't be surprised if loyal
followers were totally making up stories about how this reddit always bashes him
just to defend him.   Sure, he’s human, but compared to the mediocrity of the
Baker administration appointees, Eng isn’t just running laps — he’s already
broken the tape, grabbed the trophy, and is halfway through the victory parade.
And let’s be clear: the GM of the T can’t control acts of God like an (Amtrak)
catenary falling on a signal bungalow, extreme heat warping rails, or a bus
engine giving up mid-run. What he *can* do — and has done — is fix the obvious
problems that past leaders ignored. Now he’s tackling the hard stuff: reshaping
the agency’s entire culture. He’s not bunting for singles; he’s swinging for the
fences, whether it’s SCR Phase II, double tracking, or whatever bold project he
dreams up next. The man’s a game-changer. Praise Eng.  Glad to be a part of this
cult reddit for daddy Eng.

So I’m sitting on one of the “new” (2 year old) RL trains, and there is a blind
passenger aboard.  The train confidently announces that we are arriving at
Downtown Crossing, the station we just left. And then that we are at Downtown
Crossing, when we are of course at Park.  “Excuse me, this is actually Park
Street, correct?” they ask another passenger.  “Correct, Park Street.”  “Thank
you!”  They get off at the stop.  Those audio announcements are audible in the
cab. The operator would have _seen_ a visually impaired customer board - the
white cane is hard to miss - and still didn’t bother to fix the stop or make
their own announcement.  The MBTA was sued, back in the 1970’s, over ADA issues
like this. They spent **tens of millions of dollars** adding automated, visual
and audio messages to trains starting in 1980 because the operators and onboard
PA systems couldn’t cut it.  Those millions are now **permanently** wasted - not
a penny of value out of it - because this blind rider knows they can **never
ever trust the stop announcements again**.   There will be no apology from the
T. No improvements to a broken system. No way for people to confirm that the
stop announcement isn’t just wishful thinking. The only saving grace was
something that didn’t cost millions to install, but instead paid $2.40 to be
there: another passenger.  From the T: just incompetence.

Title: Yet Another Fantasy Map

Author: saladboyred (ID: t2_1w933mwr)
Posted: 2025-06-09 14:32:51 UTC
Post ID: 1l76czk

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inspired by other users’ maps on this Reddit, and incorporating my own ideas,
this is my current vision for an expanded MBTA. In designing extensions, the
main factors I considered were density and connectivity; what places remain
underserved, and what important corridors are disconnected? Please note that I
am not an engineer, and so may get terminology or track details wrong. I am
simply a regular T rider that loves staring at maps.   **Red Line:**
Northbound, the Red Line extends from Alewife under the Minuteman Corridor
through Arlington, terminating at East Lexington. Arlington is far denser than
Lexington, but I wanted to give Lexington at least one station since it is not
on the Commuter Rail.   Southbound, the Ashmont and Braintree branches now split
at Savin Hill rather than JFK/UMass (name reverted to Columbia,) allowing for
double-tracking on the Old Colony Line. The Braintree Branch is unchanged
besides gaining an infill station at Neponset. Meanwhile, the Ashmont Line
extends to fully take over the Mattapan Trolley, terminating at Mattapan with a
single station in Milton in-between. This removes the need for a transfer versus
the MBTA’s current plan to rehabilitate the Mattapan Line. For more, I’d
recommend reading Sky Rose’s
[article](https://medium.com/@skyqrose/red-line-extension-to-mattapan-b7351aa782e).
**Orange Line:**  Northbound, the Orange Line continues along the Haverhill Line
into Melrose, picking up some dense areas. Southward, the line forks at Forest
Hills, with one branch continuing south to Dedham, and the other to West
Roxbury, taking over the Needham Line. Due to the engineering challenges of
double-tracking through Needham, as well as the town’s suburban nature, I
decided instead to replace the rest of the line with a shuttle service,
extending to the D-Line.   **Blue Line:**  Westward, the Red-Blue Connector is
realized, bringing the Blue Line to Charles/MGH, and then further along the
esplanade to Kenmore. From here, it takes over the Green Line D-Branch out to
Riverside. This brings subway service connecting Downtown to Back Bay, Fenway,
and Longwood, as well as relieving some congestion on the Green Line’s Tremont
Street Tunnel.   Northbound, the Blue Line forks at Maverick. One branch follows
Broadway through Revere and meets the Indigo Line at Linden. The other extends
from Wonderland up through Lynn, Swampscott, and finally Salem. With electrified
regional rail, extending beyond Lynn may be unnecessary, but Salem’s density and
the benefits of redundancy (especially during October) justify the full
extension.  **Green Line:**  The Green Line gets some significant changes. First
of all, Boylston is closed and replaced with a straighter tunnel (less
screeching.) As previously covered, the D Branch no longer exists, instead being
taken over by the Blue Line. The B Branch to Boston College Remains the same.
The C Branch takes over the Northern part of the current D Branch, and extends
from Union Square to Porter.  The North of the E Branch extends one stop to meet
the Commuter Rail at West Medford. Southbound, service continues through Forest
Hills and then connects with the Red Line and a new F Branch at Mattapan. This F
Branch follows Blue Hills Ave and Washington Street before joining the rest of
the Green Line at Park Street. This brings needed service to the South End,
Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan, given the high demand on the 28 Bus and the
need to make up for broken promises on the Washington Street corridor. 
Finally, a new G Branch is added, branching from the new ROW used by the E
Branch. In the East, this runs through South Boston, terminating at Castle
Island. From North Station, it follows the Grand Junction Line through
Cambridge, connecting with the Red Line through a concourse, and then along the
Worcester Line, meeting the Blue Line at Riverside.  **Indigo Line:**  The first
new rapid transit line, this converts the current Fairmount Line to frequent
service, and then follows the new North-South connector through Aquarium, before
forking at North Station. One branch cuts through Cambridge, hitting Inman
Square and Harvard, before following the Fitchburg Line through Watertown and
Waltham. The other branch goes through Charlestown, Chelsea, Everett, Malden,
and Saugus before connecting to the Blue Line at Revere.   **Circle Line:**
Ambitious, yet vital, the Circle/Yellow Line transforms the T by allowing for
connections outside of the Downtown core. Starting at Harvard, the Circle Line
goes through Cambridge and Somerville, replacing the Silver Line through
Everett, Chelsea, East Boston, Logan Airport, Seaport, and South Station. From
there, it continues through South Boston and Dorchester before forking into two
branches: one up Mass Ave on its way back to Harvard; the other through
Longwood, Brookline, and Allston. Were it to be built, it would easily become
the most-ridden line on the system.   **Odds and Ends:**  Less essential to the
overall design, but desirable in a “full-build,” the Mystic Valley Line (not
married to the name) and South Shore Line bring service to areas the system
would not otherwise reach, such as Medford Square, Winthrop, and Hull. 
Additionally, this map assumes an electrified Regional Rail service on the
Commuter Rail, as well as extensions to New Hampshire and elsewhere.   Other
routes I considered were Indigo service through Belmont/Orange to Lynn, a
restored Green Line A Branch, and Orange Line to Norwood, but I decided against
each of these for one reason or another.

My friend is on a train heading toward Davis right now and was lamenting to me
that the train was crawling along. The conductor came on and said that the train
was “broken down” and they were doing everything they could to keep moving. They
came to a stop between Porter and Davis and have not moved since. The Conductor
noted that they’re doing everything they can to get the train moving again, but
they’ve been stuck there for 15+ minutes. My friend also just texted that there
was a loud bang and the car she was in started to fill with smoke, so she and
the rest of the passengers moved the adjacent car through the emergency exit.

Of the more than 180 responses to our poll, 27% gave Eng an A, followed close
behind with 23% of readers giving him a modest B. The other half of readers gave
Eng average to below-average grades C (17%), D (13%), and F (20%).  Many readers
who gave the MBTA an “A” and “B” grade praised Eng and his handling of the
troubled agency.  Others who were more critical of the agency said while
progress has been made, there is much left to improve.  **RATING OF C**  “The
slow zone improvement is a great first step toward becoming a world class
system. As far as GM Eng goes, he gets an A for being able to achieve as much as
he has in one year, but the T has been in disrepair/debt for so long there is
still much more to do. I look forward to being able to give the T an A but
that’ll take some time to achieve.” – Filipe C., East Boston.  **RATING OF F**
“The MBTA fixes things only after they are broken. They do not maintain any of
the infrastructure. For example, the once impressive and beautiful Harvard
Square station is filthy and falling apart. Train stations overstaffed with
workers who stand around and do nothing demonstrate how our tax dollars are
being wasted on unnecessary jobs. There is nothing here to be happy or proud
of.” – Robert P., Boston  **RATING OF A**  “Great job Eng and MBTA! The T and
commuter rail services are on time and regularly running during the week. If
only there was more weekend service with better timed bus connections.” –

So looking into the Gateway Tunnel project one thing being done there is
splitting it into multiple projects. Such as Hudson Yards concrete casing, NY/NJ
tunnel digging, Sawtooth bridge replacement, existing tunnel rehab etc.   While
not one for one I think part of the issue with N-S projects is we often think of
it as 1 big project. So instead of that what are the projects it can be broken
down into. Ideally which of those can be done before the main project?  Here is
what I can think of:  * Electrification of lines * Fairmount line upgrades to
support Amtrak during work? For some reason I think this is needed but not sure
* Project right of way build outs * Tunneling * Central Station buildout if
needed * North Station underground Platforms build out * South Station
underground platform build out * Maintenance yard relocations further outside

electrification, right of ways, and others people come up can potentially be

Title: Cr platform question

I was reading about accessibility &amp; saw that some cr stations that have mini
highs are limited in using full level platforms due to needing freight train
clearance. Are the cars too wide to fit if they did use full level? Also, what
is the rated lifespan of a mini high? In 2015 one broke at north Billerica &amp;
the pic is pretty gnarly. As we all know, the t is slowly looking into
overhauling how cr works. We all hope regional rail will be the end goal, but
can we really achieve that with certain stations not being accessible? Will the
temporary platforms being looked at be enough to get the job done? A few
stations use them or are being built with them in mind.

I don’t ride the green line that often, but I started a new job that I can get
to via either the D or E branches. The train got here, I sat down but there was
a long line of people trying to get in. About 4 people get on after me, and the
doors close on her backpack. There’s at least 5 people behind her trying to get
on.  She obviously pried the doors off her bag, two more people get on. Doors
close on them too. They also have to pry them open to get on. And the last two
barely make it on before they close again. These weren’t people running up last
minute. They’d all been standing there since before the train arrived and were
politely waiting their turn to get on.  I thought the doors may be broken, but
the conductor then got on the intercom and literally yelled STOP PULLING OPEN
THE DOORS. What were they expected to do? Just ride along with their bag stuck
in the door? Let the doors close in their faces when there’s plenty of room and
seats and they’ve been waiting their turn?  Does this happen often on GL? I’ve
never seen trains just try to close the doors passengers be damned if people are
still actively boarding.

I did this work many years back, but the MBTA/DOT had no interest in it, because
it obviates the very purpose of the whole project, which was/is for the benefit
of Boston property developers.  The USPS waterfront property is highly
valuable/costly, so why not trump up a transit need, use the taxpayers to push
them out, and pay air-rights, a fraction of the cost.    I think the project
price tag got to be so high, however, that the air-rights costs went up as well,
but it doesn't change the fact that the whole 'need' was trumped up originally.
Seeing the already absurd price tag for the mere addition of a few new berths,
egads, I put my mind to finding a viable (engineering and operational wise)
solution that doesn't require relocating the USPS facility.    Most just see the
hemmed in situation on each side.  Others go further, looking vertically, but
see that taking tracks up are precluded by several obstacles, and taking them
lower is a no go with the Big Dig fubar, but as well the MBTA still uses fume
emitting engines, which is why over 100 years back the lower level loop was
abandoned.     The epiphany came, when I saw the length of the station and
original platforms.  It was built at at time when trains were the planes of
today, and train stations were the airports.  Trains were long, and so were
platforms.  But, the principal use today is for commuter trips, which is the
purported 'need' put forward by the MBTA.   Train lengths are but a fraction of
what the stations was built to handle.  Ergo, make use of the station's 'length'
to create more berths.   However, it became complicated again, because the DOT
had placed supports for the added bus station overhead 'between' adjacent
tracks/berths, rather than using platform space.  To be fair, I imagine there
was a need to create a solid footing, and that was easier done with the open
ground (even if narrow) between tracks than having to tear up and restore
portions of the platforms.  It was a troubling impediment, for two reasons.
First, to free up space for outer berths, required providing access to inner
berths that bypasses them.  This requires a track shift, but that's where the
bus station supports become problematic.  The narrow (between tracks) supports
meant they needed more of them, a spacing which precludes track shifts between
adjacent tracks.    The only alternative is to shift three track widths over,
also having to split the platforms.  Not only does this double the length of the
shift, troubling enough, it now presents a second problem.  Originally, it was
easy to envision that passengers would use the same platforms for boarding the
outer berths as the inner berths.  But, bisecting the platforms in order to
solve the first problem throws a wrench into that plan.      Epiphany #2.  I had
knowledge.  One, I'd had a lifetime of using Atlanta's airport, where you go
below ground to access outer concourses.  You could use a 'people mover' train,
or you could walk.   As well, at many airports, moving walkways are options when
needing traverse signifcant distances.     Thus, it only made sense to use the
same concept for South Station.  ESPECIALLY given the other knowledge, which is
that the headhouse at South Station has a lower level, today used primarily for
storage.  Indeed, they'd once had a lower level platform (later abandoned).
The two things, made me see that the original problem brought me to a wonderful
new passenger benefit.  Not only would an underground concourse allow access to
outer berths/platforms, it also could be accessed at the outer portions of the
inner berths, allowing passengers using them the convenience of a climate
controlled environment, either going or coming; a major convenience in Boston
winters.    But, that wasn't the only benefit.  The underground concourse would
lead to the head house, where passengers could continue on the lower level if
wanting to access the Red or Silver rail  lines, whose entries are at the same
level; bypassing the more congested main terminal space.  Still, yet another
potential benefit.  The main concourse would run beneath Platform D, and it is
centered beneath the bus terminal.  Escalators could connect it with the main
undergournd concourse, providing bus passenger much easier and more climate
friendly access to reach Dewey Square, or the Red and Silver Lines.   Space
considerations on the platforms were factored in, but expounding on the
particulars is too much for this introduction.   I had begun an implentation
plan, showing the manner (steps) in which the underground concourses, and other
pieces, would have been constructed without undue impact on operations, but what
was the point?  DOT is run by the special interests in Boston.    In fact, I saw
the opportunity (while it was open) for excavating further down to create the
space for a future metro rail line/station running perpendicular to the Red
Line.  That's getting too useful though, for Boston, who'd rather have a useless
intercity rail line put through, ugh.  Metro rail is FAR more
manueverable/flexible in routing than intercity rail, and FAR more useful for
local needs, but I digress.      It's all for naught.  The DOT has, since my
work, begun its wasteful enclosure $$$$, and will waste more of your dollars as
soon as you send them enough (via your clueless politicians).   Make your checks
payable to MassDOT Special Interests Cronyism, P.O. Box 666, Boston, MA 02116.
Don't believe me, here's your smoking gun . . .
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSi3QzHMNx4Bit2IO0svA67nmMxhpXHEQsiCyZPjMEM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSi3QzHMNx4Bit2IO0svA67nmMxhpXHEQsiCyZPjMEM/edit?usp=sharing)
It reveals the switcheroo pulled by the MassDOT on which sites were the final
three to be included in the, federally required, environmental study for the
commuter rail layover 'facility' (parking lot).   They ignored THEIR OWN vetting
process, done BEFORE property developers got interested in the Widett Circle
site.   Though very telling, he Globe would not report on that; their fear of
the city's power players, one can only conclude.  Recall, the Globe took
**many** years to get the nerve up to expose the child abuse they knew of in the
city's Catholic diocese; doing so only after stories had broken across the
country, so they feared them less.

it's too wet, or just generally," and therefore not to be relied upon during my

I am on my morning commute and I just found a brand new CRRC train set that is
not showing anything on the screens nor showing the destination of the train (it
is a Braintree-bound train with train number #1908). I have been seeing more CAF
Green Line and CRRC Red Line having severe issues with either not displaying
anything at all on their screens, having the old design of the green (with no
screen for connections), or operators not using the automatic voice system to
alert passengers of each station and where doors open.   Why does this normally
happen and what could be done to help better report trains that are
malfunctioning or to get operators to use the automatic system when possible? (I
know this is a major issue on the old RL trains with the speakers being broken,
etc).

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s begin with disclaimers.  1.) I only rode to Jackson Square and North
Station only once (meaning a round-trip). This should *NOT* be taken as factual.
We need to wait a couple of days before seeing whether the OL became better (in
terms of speed and time).  2.) I rode two OL trains on my trip back to N.
Station because I stopped at Ruggles to look at the station. This means that
there could be a slower time due to the operator. I also only timed when the
train was in motion.  3.) I do not ride the OL regularly (I am a Red Line/ Bus
66 rider).  Firstly, the train went by smoothly aside from the same few pockets
that has remained under a slow zone. To be more specific, the State,
Ruggles-Roxbury Crossing, and Back Bay- Tufts Med. Center areas all were clocked
in over 2 minutes between each station on an inbound or outbound ride. Reminder
that this shutdown was meant to remove 4 slow zones, so do not expect a big
change in your commute. All other stations were clocked at about 45 seconds to 1
1/2 minutes between each one, which is pretty good for a subway.  Jackson Square
and Roxbury Crossing still has outdated line maps (showing the GL going to
Lechmere instead of the GLX).  Looking at Ruggles, the escalator is still broken
between the platform and the lobby. I did see a new Ruggles renovation and
Commuter Rail map, however, which will be shown.  Overall, I would say the
shutdown was good, but does need to be focused on Roxbury Crossing-State to see
a major change for the OL (and save minutes for riders, alongside Green
St.-Stony Brook and the CC slow zones.

So, we really haven't gotten a straight answer on what's wrong with the GLX
tracks. What we know:  * The tracks are too narrow * Too narrow tracks could
derail a train * Some tolerance is allowed with the actual gauge of the tracks
and the T is within that leeway * The contractor is totally at fault, as is the
T and everyone else who knew about it and let it happen  However, if the gauge
is within tolerance, do the tracks need to be fixed? Is there another issue that
we just don't know about here? Is it an abundance of caution that they are doing
these fixes? Is it really broken or do we need to get the contractor to fix it
now under some sort of warranty?

Usually there's at least one escalator (2 were broken for almost a week last
week) that needs repair, but they fix it pretty quickly.  Are they waiting for
back ordered parts or something?

So, I send a message to the MBTA about the "condition" of the EV charging
stations in Littleton - 3 of the 4 chargers have been broken for about 4 years,
and now the fourth is dead with the whole pylon laying on the ground. Their
repsonse, from Keolis Parking:  &gt; EV charging support has been suspended and
there are currently no plans  in place to continue support. You can find all the
information you need  for parking-related matters, including payments at
WWW.MBTA.COM/PARKING. If you have any further questions, please reach us at
https://www.mbta.com/customer-support.   Which is interesting, since HR5060-2022
says:  &gt;(b) Not later than July 1, 2023 the Massachusetts Department of
Transportation, working in cooperation with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority and regional transit authorities, shall make provision for installing
and maintaining in good working order electric vehicle charging stations for
public use at: (i) all service plazas located on the Massachusetts Turnpike;
(ii) parking lots of at least 5 commuter rail stations; (iii) parking lots of at
least 5 subway stations; and (iv) a parking lot of at least 1 ferry terminal.
Charging stations should be of  quantity and type appropriate to the pattern of
utilization expected at each site.  &amp;#x200B;

 Okay, so here we are again with the “up” escalator between the Red Line and
South Station dead, after only a couple of months of service.  Okay. We get it.
You have a crappy landlord who didn’t care that the fire sprinklers in the
entire station didn’t work for a year (and yet the DOT hasn’t seen fit to void
their lease yet).  But take a look at that other escalator. See that little
keyswitch? How it has both “up” and “down”?  You can run any escalator in either
direction.   Know how when there’s only one escalator and a set of stairs the
escalator is always “up”? That’s because the average crowd goes up a flight of
stairs much more slowly than they go down. People climb stairs at the rate of
the slowest one. It cripples traffic flow, and when a subway train is late and
people are running for the commuter rail they don’t exactly want to wait in line
for five minutes just to climb the stairs.  Porter Square is the deepest
platform in the system. 105 feet from the surface - 10 stories - with three
escalators and the most monster set of stairs most people will see.  In true
MBTA fashion, two escalators are broken. The remaining one? Down.  Of course.

I rode the T for the first time this week since early 2020 and could not figure

fare machine to purchase 1 subway ride on a Charlie Ticket.  However the fare
gates would not accept that ticket no matter what direction I inserted it. The
ticket also did not have the orange arrow.  Now I’m wondering if I purchased the
wrong thing. Or if the machines are just broken!? I just selected the quick
options just for 1 subway ride thinking that is exactly what I need.

Looking in the Globe at how the Transit ambassadors cost $100 million over 5

Braintree have all been stuck on the same number of free spaces for the last
several days without ever changing.  Other stations appear to be moving up or
down, so while I can't vouch for whether the numbers they show are 100%
accurate, they at least appear to be adding or subtracting vehicles as they
enter/exit.

grinds. to a halt. Each of those things happens multiple times in a typical day,
with somewhat less frequent derailments and downed trees across the tracks to
liven things up. It's a linear sequence of single points of failure. It's broken
by design and will never work reliably. Shuttle buses are slow to respond,
packed like sardine cans, and crawl along at a snail's pace because they're
trying as best they can to parallel a train line, which is typically an utterly
pathological bus route.     I'm going to look into commuting by bus. It's
slower, and it contributes to traffic, but it seems far more reliable than the
trains, in part because it utilizes a highly redundant network of
taxpayer-subsidized roads that have received far more investment than the tracks
and associated infrastructure are ever likely to receive. Also, the MBTA can
easily buy buses off the rack, in contrast to the bespoke train cars they're
obliged to buy, because roads are a widely implemented standard.  Thoughts?

Title: MBTA Outline of possible 2026 Service Changes and Modifications

Posted: 2025-10-17 23:18:45 UTC
Post ID: 1o9gbpc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s what to expect for **2026** in the MBTA’s Bus Network Redesign, based on
current **Phase 2** planning materials. The agency is rolling changes out in
quarterly packages (not one big cutover), with the more complex items scheduled
for 2026. All of this is still **draft** and depends on hiring and bus-priority
projects, but it’s the clearest preview we have right now.   One major 2026
package groups **routes 16/17/18**: Route **16** is slated to be upgraded to a
**Frequent** route (≤15 minutes all day) with its maze of variants simplified;
Route **17** would add early-morning and late-night Sunday trips; Route **18**
would extend from Andrew to JFK/UMass. Trade-offs called out in the draft
include new transfers from a truncated 16 and the loss of Saturday service on
18. The package also flags supporting capital at key transfer points and
targeted transit priority on Columbia Road, Arborway, and Talbot/Dot corridors.
Another headline item is **Route 22**, proposed to extend and be promoted to
**Frequent** with stronger late-night and Sunday service. That change hinges on
new layover/berthing and better transfer access, and it’s explicitly tied to the
ongoing **Longwood Medical Area** (LMA) bus circulation work, with
recommendations expected around **winter 2026** to help finalize routing and
street operations. In short: more all-day frequency, but expect some rerouted
patterns and trade-offs to make the extension work.   A separate package covers
**routes 42/47/91**, with the **47** established as a **Frequent** cross-river
link and coordinated adjustments on the 42 and 91; the draft shows a substantial
**+46%** service increase for that trio. For the **112/113/114** cluster, the
plan simplifies the network by leveraging earlier upgrades—delivering a **+62%**
service increase and adding a new connection to Assembly—while noting trade-offs
like the 112 losing a one-seat Orange Line connection and the 114 no longer
serving a Market Basket stop. These are framed as 2026-and-beyond items, each
advancing on its own timeline as staffing and street treatments line up.   Two
big enablers explain *how* these 2026 packages can actually stick: (1)
**operator headcount** has been climbing, with MBTA reporting 99%+ of scheduled
bus service operated and a path to grow service again; and (2) new
**bus-lane/stop camera enforcement** authority (enacted in 2025) is rolling out,
aimed at protecting bus lanes and reducing delay, alongside shelter, signage
(including E-ink), and accessibility upgrades at hundreds of stops systemwide.
Those operational and capital pieces are the backbone for making the draft
service increases reliable once they go live.   Bottom line: **2026** is
positioned for the “harder” network moves—more routes reaching **Frequent**
status, simplified patterns, and targeted extensions—implemented in waves as
hiring, layovers, and street priority come together. Expect final details and
exact “effective” dates to publish closer to each seasonal schedule change, but
this is the current blueprint the agency is working from.

I've officially lost all hope in the Green Line. It's 2025, and we're supposed
to be living in the future, but the MBTA is out here running trains like we're
still in the 1800s. Yeah, yeah, Boston loves to brag about having the oldest
subway system in America - congratulations, but maybe it's time to ACT like it's
not still 1897?  I had an RMV appointment at Haymarket the morning this incident
happened. Left WAY before I needed to because I've learned my lesson with this
garbage system. And what happens? The train sits at Copley for 15+ minutes with
zero explanation. Then they finally announce, "Park Street will be the last
stop, this train is being taken out of service." Are you fucking kidding me? So
I get off, wait another 10 minutes for the next train, and then THAT train sits
there for another 20 minutes.  I missed my appointment. The one that took me
weeks to schedule. Because the MBTA can't manage to run a single train line
properly.  And here's what really pisses me off - they shut down parts of the
Green Line ALL THE TIME for "improvements" and "engineering work." So where are
these improvements? What are they actually fixing? Because from where I'm
standing (or sitting on a delayed train), nothing has changed. If anything, it's
gotten WORSE.  How is it so difficult to run a train line? Other cities figured
this out decades ago. Tokyo's trains run on 30-second intervals and are never
late. But Boston can't even get a train to complete its route without taking it
out of service halfway through?  I'm so tired of this. The Green Line is an
absolute joke, and I don't know how much longer I can keep making excuses for
it.  EDIT: I WAS ALREADY LATE FOR THE RMV THING BECAUSE OF THE PARK STREET
FIASCO.. I DID TAKE THE ORANGE LINE AND YES I COULD HAVE TAKEN IT EARLY BUT THE

On older Red Line trains, when arriving at stations like Park Street where doors
open on both sides, operators often wait like 5-10 seconds after opening the
doors on the right to open the doors on the left. I noticed this does not happen
with new Red Line trains.   Was there a purpose to the delay? If so, why doesn't

​Over a year ago, cell service stopped working beneath the Shawmut headhouse. It
made tracking delays (and ultimately giving up and ordering an Uber to work) a
major hassle. Also likely a safety issue not having the ability to contact
Transit PD in an emergency.   As of this week, five bars of LTE service are
back! Cell service is also now available in the tunnel north of Shawmut where
the Ashmont branch comes above ground at Park Street.

TransitMatters made a post with [an idea for using the Tobin Bridge in part for
transit](https://transitmatters.org/blog/where-is-chelsea-mbta-subway-station).
While their post describes potential stations in Chelsea and beyond, it doesn’t
explore where the line could go once it’s in Boston. Here’s some crayon ideas on
where I think it could go using existing services/infrastructure/ROWs to
minimize cost similar to Montreals REM:  1) Blue Line to Chelsea via MGH After
MGH, the line would elevate above ground, cross the Charles on a short bridge,
then connect to the lower level on ramp of the Tobin. This is the highest
capacity and would provide the greatest train frequencies of my proposals. I
assume it follows the current Route 1 alignment. Cons with this are there would
be heavy transfers at downtown stations since it would not make sense for
someone to ride from Chelsea to maverick &amp; beyond and vice versa. The
incline from MGH to Science Park/ West End might also be too much.  2) Green
Line to Chelsea After Science Park/West End, a flat junction and bridge across
the Charles would connect to the lower level on-ramp for the Tobin (I don’t
think there’s space for a grade separated junction like the GLX one. This
proposal would be easier to add a second branch and would allow all 4 green line
branches to go through the entire central subway instead of short turns at gov
center. Stations would be cheaper to construct as well. There is space by Route
1 in West Revere where a highway connection was intended to be built that could
be repurposed for a rail yard. Cons are speed &amp; capacity, the flat junction,
and potential for delays with all the interlining in the central subway. There
is also the issue of trains need to wait at north station until a trolley ahead
clear Science Park/West End.  3) Grand Junction to Chelsea A new light rail line
using the Grand Junction from Allston/West Station to Chelsea. Grade crossings
at Mass Ave and Main St in Cambridge could keep costs down. A cross platform
transfer with the orange line could be made so that inbound riders from Chelsea
can cross the platform to inbound Boston OL trains.   Cons are it would sever
the connection between the north and south sides of the commuter rail system and
it would miss transfers with the red and green lines in Cambridge. The at grade
Cambridge crossings can also be tricky to cross given current traffic (could be
mitigated with gates and signal priority)   The Tobin lower level might be able
to fit a lane of traffic so that there’s two lanes in each direction. If not, it
could be one lane in each direction on the upper deck with the middle lane
alternating direction based on rush hour.  Open to any ideas on these, thought
it’d be fun to share.

Apologies if the correct flair was not applied.  2 out of 4 signals are
activated despite barriers being raised and it seems to be disrupting the
traffic light system near it making it stuck on red.   I called the number to
report the issue to the MBTA and police were sent out to manually direct
traffic. They were waiting on someone from the MBTA to come check the signal
box. Unfortunately I had to walk home and could not stay longer to wait.
Hopefully the issue is resolved before the next trains so that nobody gets hit!
and if not, now you know why the Framingham/Worcester line might be delayed
today. Seeing nothing about such delays on the schedule as of right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;The MBTA today announced the launch of “The RIDE – MBTA” mobile app and a
new online booking portal for paratransit RIDE customers. These new tools
provide customers with better flexibility in scheduling trips, updating some
account information, adding funds to their accounts, and tracking their trips –
all features that customers have requested.  &gt;“Everyone deserves the ability
to choose public transportation, and the freedom to easily use The RIDE is a
priority. I’m proud of our Paratransit team for their commitment to improving
the rider experience,” **said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng**.
“Making it easier to schedule and use The RIDE with new customer-facing tools
like the online portal and mobile app will improve service and the experience
for all that need or choose transit.”  &gt;These new customer tools come as part
of a larger software transition for The RIDE. Over Labor Day weekend, The RIDE
launched a new transportation management system developed
by [Spare](https://spare.com/).  &gt;Customers can now book trips in three ways:
&gt;By Portal:      &gt;The new online booking portal available
at [mbta.com/BookTheRide](https://www.mbta.com/BookTheRide).     &gt;By App:  
&gt;Customers can find the new “The RIDE – MBTA” mobile app in both the Apple
App and Google Play store. More information is also
at [mbta.com/apps](https://www.mbta.com/mbta-endorsed-apps).     &gt;The “The
RIDE – MBTA” app’s icon has a light blue background with “The RIDE” and an
outline of a RIDE van on it.     &gt;By Phone:     &gt;Calling The RIDE Access
Center (TRAC) at (844) 427-7433 (TTY: (857) 206-6569) to speak to a
reservationist.  &gt;Both the online booking portal and mobile app were reviewed
for accessibility and tested by internal and external users.  &gt;“It’s
important that we keep evolving and improving both our operations and customer
experience,” **said MBTA Chief of Paratransit Services Michele Stiehler**. “We
want to make sure our customers can rely on us for safe, timely transportation
and have any questions or concerns addressed as they arise.”  &gt;Along with the
new mobile app and web portal, Spare brings real-time trip optimization to The
RIDE, which means more efficient scheduling and a better ability to react to
unexpected delays like traffic or customer emergencies.  &gt;Over the past few
years, The RIDE has made steady progress in improving operations, customer
service, and engagement. Recent upgrades include:  &gt;Better on-time trip
performance  &gt;Shorter call hold times at TRAC  &gt;Investing in both
operations and customer-facing staff  &gt;Partnering with the MBTA’s System-Wide
Accessibility (SWA) team to offer additional support at the Mobility Center to
assist customers in finding accessible transportation options  &gt;Improving the
RIDE Flex application process and shortening application turnaround time
&gt;Partnering with the MBTA’s Technology and Innovation Department to develop
Ride Along, a previously used vehicle tracking tool.

I was having a lunch with a friend in Somerville and overheard two Keolis
employees talking about robbing Peter to pay Paul on locomotive parts and how
"Bad things have gotten in the stores (not sure what that is)". My friend asked
what they meant by robbing Peter, and they explained how they take a "good part"
off a bad train to fix a train close to going back out because they don't have
the parts to replace them. How often does this happen and how long has it been
happening? Does this kind of part swapping get tracked? How are they verifying
the part they steal off one train will work? Is this another of many reasons why
there have been so many cancelations/delays on the commuter rail? This isn't
right and doesn't seem safe..

The Red Line was a dream last week. It was fast and reliable. This week, the T
to and from Braintree has been delayed. Nothing major, but at least 10-15
minutes in the morning and evening commute. It’s enough to make you late for

So I’ve been riding the Red Line to school since December 2023 after my sister
messed up and made me late to school. So with that being said I’m in a similar
predicament now because this year my school updated their attendance policy to
include that you can only be tardy 3 times per term or else you fail the year
instead of the way it was before were you just got detention after being tardy 5
times so with the Red Line being fucked 3/7 days of the week I don’t know what
to do I would take the 210 but it leaves around 7ish which means I would have to
get up incredibly early to get to school and just sit there waiting which I
don’t really wanna do. I’ve also considered just taking an earlier RL train but
then it runs into the same issue where if it’s incredibly delayed again I’m
screwed. I tried taking the CR from QC to JFK then just take Braintree to NQ but
that was like $8 total just for similar results. If it helps in only going from
QC to NQ to be at school by 7:45.

Title: Can MBTA pluck anything useful from SEPTA service cuts?

Author: Moohog86 (ID: t2_l0ced)
Posted: 2025-09-01 00:26:02 UTC
Post ID: 1n5aj6t

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Background:** Septa has to make about 45% service cuts to cover a large
shortfall the Republican Senators are forcing on Septa. PA republicans are
basically following the 'eliminate public transit' part of project 2025 to make
room for more ubers.   Specific lines will be eliminated January 1st, but
service cuts were supposed to start this week.   For more lols, three
republicans in philly are suing Septa to prevent  service cuts without any
additional funds. They found a judge that agrees with them and now there is a
court order that will likely push Septa into insolvency.    **Equipment
effected:** **5 commuter rail lines.** Most of these use EMU's. The older ones
are from 1973, so they are old. They have 271 old Silverline IV's. I doubt SEPTA
would sell the V's.  There might be some catenaries that are no longer are used,
but some of these share routes with others. Still all this EMU stuff could be
the start of Fairmont electrification.   There could be another line effected;
as SEPTA will no longer pay amtrak operation fees and Amtrak might ditch the
keystone line. These are diesel trainsets that were due to be replaced by 2030.
They could be a good starting stock for east west rail.   **Trolleys**  G1 are
PCC 3 cars from the 1940's. Does mattapan need more? I think they have green
line cars on the way...  B3 is kawasaki IV subway cars. They could maybe do some
red line action to get rid of our poor rolling stock and to dull the delays from
CRRC.   T1 is are kawasaki type k. I know nothing about these.   **Buses** 50
bus routes are being eliminated. Septa has various new flyer buses. Somewhat
older and common are DE40LF(r) and E40LFR which I think MBTA already uses. They
aren't bad busses.   **Personnel** Too bad I feel MBTA just got past their
worker shortage. But maybe there is more hiring for bus drivers...

A handful of times a day, the MBTA reports delays due to a disabled

stock). What are the most common issues and how do they resolve them? Is it
mostly on the Type 7s/15-1700s or also on the newer trains? Given how quickly
they are usually cleared, I assume it’s not an issue with the train’s ability to
move? Thanks!

Title: SCR Phase 2 is likely dead… but what about an short Easton extension?

I know any form of Commuter Rail expansion is basically off the table for the
foreseeable future, and this is more of a thought experiment than a serious
prediction. Please also, for the love of god, don’t bring up Old Colony
double-tracking for the millionth time.  What I’ve been thinking about is
whether a limited extension of the Stoughton Line to Easton could make sense in
lieu of the long-abandoned SCR Phase 2. The real value here is that it avoids
the politically toxic and environmentally fraught push through Raynham and the
Hockomock Swamp, and this short extension could be pulled off with diesel
service in mind.   The right-of-way between Stoughton and Easton is mostly
intact and unobstructed, with abandoned track still visible in places and no
significant utility conflicts. From an engineering standpoint, it’s one of the
cleaner options the T could dust off if it ever felt compelled to expand. Easton
itself is growing, and the proximity to Stonehill College (right along the
corridor) and Wheaton College not far off makes it a natural catchment for both
student commuters and the wider Bristol County market that currently lacks good
rail access.  Other factors could also come into play. The MBTA in the past has
floated the idea of realigning portions of the Stoughton ROW to modernize
curves. More importantly, Canton Junction has long been a bottleneck where the
Stoughton branch peels off the Providence Line. In a best-case scenario, the
junction really should be rebuilt as a flying junction to eliminate conflicts
and reduce the cascading delays that currently ripple through both lines. Any
extension project would naturally bring those conversations back to the
forefront, since the utility of adding new service is undermined if the
bottleneck remains unsolved.  No one’s pretending this is on MassDOT’s priority
list, but compared to the billion-plus price tag and environmental headaches of
pushing the line through to Taunton, an Easton extension is relatively
low-hanging fruit. It wouldn’t deliver the full South Coast Rail vision, but it
would provide a modest expansion.

I can't count the number of times I have seen the C line operators at Cleveland

even though it's been way longer than the normal delay between trains? Today I
was waiting the first stop after Cleveland Circle and the train sat there for 15
minutes, ran express past our stop and then it took another 10 minutes for
another train to finally pick us up and no one seemed in a hurry or apologetic.
Thankfully my schedule was flexible but I can't imagine infuriating it must to
someone who was going to be early to an appointment and ends up being late. Am I
missing something or do they just not care?

info on trains delayed in the morning please!*  ***Table of Contents***  *
Preface * General Info on maintenance and issue * Connections and Service
Changes (Updated periodically) * Maintenance/Service Timeline (Updated
periodically, with news stories) * Train trackers * Human Reminder * TLDR  #
Preface: Recent Providence and Franklin line delays  I’ve seen a lot of posts
and comments about the same topic that’s been affecting a majority of us the
past week or so, and wanted to make a thread that could be used to ask
questions, give a little bit of technical info instead of the “something
happened to the tracks, gonna be delayed” to give people a better understanding,
and to generally communicate with others as I believe this will be an issue for
at least the next week-month (good chance even longer) (I know other lines are
experiencing delays with this as well, but ridership wise and delay wise it
seemed appropriate to label it as such)  # General Info  Friday, August 1st, an
Amtrak overhead catenary wire fell, and in addition, a signal box located
in-between Hyde Park &amp; Readville station burst into flames, disabling all
control over the interlocking (the section of track in between a group of
signals, typically with crossovers to enable trains to switch tracks)
Subsequently, Amtrak and Keolis has since put new operating rules into affect in
this area, including the disabling of the signals. You can see the signals
covered up at the moment, with the exception being track 3’s signal board still
operative. Which leads me to believe not all is lost. *(The signal on that track
may not take power or control from this specific box at all though, I just know
it’s the box for this interlocking. Strange to me that they almost certainly
took power down to the box so whether it’s running on temp power or it’s just
always powered, they have no use for the other signals due to the switches being
inoperable anyway)*  However, the addition of the temporary platform at
Readville, with the signals being covered and put out of service officially
until further notice, and the spiking of the switches *(physical spikes put
through the rail ties to secure switches in place, disabling manual control over
the switches as well, which prevents trains crossing over up until Forest
interlocking, located close to Forest Hills)* on tracks 1 &amp; 2 does not
provide a good outlook to the near future to be blunt. There’s been a wide range
of estimates thrown around, between a few days, and two months. I personally
believe it to be closer to the latter, but I hope I’m wrong as I don’t know the
complete extent of the damage.  Expect more temporary schedules to be made
available. With how new this issue is, I expect it to be trial and error of
getting it to run efficiently over the next few days given the circumstances.
They’re currently now running under a lot of pressure, as the rules are changing
day to day on operation in the area, and one missed or misunderstood sentence
can result in being put on temporary leave without pay. This is something nobody
really wants to play around with from an operating standpoint, and the rule set
they’re currently under leads to the slow speeds and long delays we’re currently
experiencing.  All these factors, mixed with delays that already exist from
either Amtrak heading into Boston, or trains late leaving out of Boston, add to
the complexity of trying to keep a consistent schedule through the area with no
consistent train timing. Not to mention workers on and around the right of way
*(its not exactly fun or safe to have a train flying by a few feet away, and
obviously there’s rules against it, particularly needing to operate at certain
speeds around trackside MOW{maintenance of way} equipment)*  **So, overall,
until they work out the kinks with what’s given, add at least 15-30 minutes to
your commute either way right now, and for the coming days. Hopefully(extremely
optimistic) just days, not weeks, and this is resolved quicker than expected,
but more than likely weeks to a month, probably more.** *(Really hoping they
prioritize this, even more than it already is, this kind of thing requires
extensive work, testing, and patience.)*  # Connections &amp; Service changes
u/Massive_Holiday noted some of the alternative connections available for
service to the Hyde Park/Readville area below in the pinned comment. As well as
mentioning to check [***MBTA.com***](http://MBTA.com) for all official

updates. May just be a small “gave us the all clear to go a bit quicker”, to

Human Reminder  **more below this, not particularly related**  The conductors on
your trains always have the best info, but please keep in mind the amount of
people on each train, and the fact they work multiple trains a day, and probably
have had to answer this question a thousand times in the past few days. It’s
just as stressful and annoying for them as it is for you. It can ***shorten
their breaks***, add stress to an already stressful situation and really ruin
their mood when ***people seem to be mad at them for something out of their
control***, and for a decent amount of them it’s ***the start of their day*** or
***their trip home*** as well, and they’re ***also losing their time.***
They’re just doing their job, don’t argue with them about how you shouldn’t have
to pay, ***pay your fare*** and ***take it up with Keolis*** for the time being.
You not paying risks them getting put out on temporary leave. ***You could ruin
somebodies livelihood***. The conductors aren’t pocketing your money or charging
you like it’s a service they offer. ***It’s their JOB***. They’re just as human
as you, working just like you’re coming from or going to work, ***think about
how early or late they work*** to get ***YOU to work and home SAFELY***. Your
***life and the hundreds of others riding with you*** are the ***responsibility
of the conductors***, and that can be a lot as it is.  The railroad is not a
great industry, and their job can be hard enough as it is dealing with extensive
rule books that are updated daily, ***management watching every move***, the not
so nice side of the general public, along with mechanical issues that they have
to work with or troubleshoot that shouldn’t be an issue in the first place. Not
to mention the fact their shifts can range from ***8-16 HOURS***, usually around
***10-12***, and a lot of them work ***6 DAYS A WEEK***. They aren’t an Uber,
they are ***extensively trained and qualified*** to be in control of the
equipment and handle situations like this, their job isn’t customer service,
it’s to safely assist in the movement of the train *(which some people for some
reason think is a pretty simple day job)* and are essentially federal/state
employees with how much federal oversight(FRA) there is, being essential workers
*(if they shut down the highways for a blizzard, guess who still has to try and
drive on said highway)* and government programs *(railroad retirement etc)*
there are that benefit them as well.  ***They don’t work on the infrastructure,
they work with what they’re given, have some compassion, and realize they’re
doing the best they can (most of them). A thank you, smile, or anything positive
can be the reason they had a good day at work. Imagine the first interaction you
have with somebody at work is a negative or rude one, just because you couldn’t
see something they were showing you or couldn’t hear you. Or just pretend you
don’t exist. The amount of people who don’t even look up when they come around
and treat them as less than human, or servants forced to get them to work is
frankly absurd, as you’d be stuck in traffic for hours without them being there.
Treat them with kindness and it’ll almost always be returned, don’t let a few
bad apples ruin it for both parties, because I guarantee your workplace has the
‘bad’ ones that you think bring a bad look to your place of work too***  # TL;DR
box in charge of choo choo track go boom boom train go slow fix hard take long
time be nice to train people  # (Actual TL;DR, Critical infrastructure failure,
extremely extensive repair work must be done, expect these delays for 2/3 weeks
to a month or two, and keep an eye on communication streams for service changes,
very fluid situation.  Pay your fare, complain to Keolis, be kind to your
conductors.)

Probably something really benign and stupid to post about but I'm really
curious. I went to the beach yesterday (Revere) and when the train pulled up at
State, a few of the cars were dark and the doors didn't open.   It wasn't a
problem at the time but I figured it was part of a bigger issue when that train
was taken out of service at Orient Heights and everyone had to get off and wait
for the next one. The next one we got on had delayed stop announcements.   I got
on the OL at DTX going to back bay around 5:30 later that day and the same thing
where some of the cars were dark and not in use. So we all had to cram in the
one of next ones.   Anyone have any idea what was going on? Is this a regular
thing that happens?

Title: Should MBTA Commuter Rail Trains Have Double Doors for Both High and Low Platforms?

With the mix of high and low platforms on the MBTA commuter rail system,
wouldn’t it make sense to have two sets of doors on each train, one for high
level boarding and another for low level boarding? It could speed up boarding,
reduce delays, and help with accessibility. Other systems around the world do
this like Caltrain. Would it save money not having each mbta CR station to be
converted to high level boarding, or would it be too expensive to maintain.
Curious what people think cost? logistics? unique issues? I am curious why the
mbta hasn't looked into this option

Really wondering what I should've done differently or not intervene at all here.
A person in a wheelchair was trying to get off the train, and they didn't have
enough power to get over the lip or something, so they were just stuck in the
doorway. I watched them for a few seconds and then got up to help push them off,
and the doors started closing. The guy stuck his leg out to try to stop the left
door but the doors kept closing anyway, and the right door was coming in, about
to trap his leg.   I instinctively tried to hold the right side door open,
hoping the door would retract or something, and after struggling for a couple of
seconds it finally did. I was able to help the wheelchair guy out, and the
operator came out of the cabin and started yelling at me and making an entire
scene for doing that.   Ended up messing up the door or something and it took
crew members around 5 minutes to fix it, so if you're on the northbound orange
line right now, I'm sorry for the delay. But I just don't know if what I really
did was really that bad. I saw a person struggle, offered to help, and then got
made out to be the villain

couldn't communicate better there. That's absolutely worth a posted alert.  I

We should be hearing more from the MBTA soon regarding what caused the downed
communication wire to become damaged within the next few days.  Delays are
expected as the MBTA begins to allow trains to Maverick and points east and
continue monitoring the power and signal system for further issues that may
occur.   Shuttle buses have been phased out.   A thread will be posted tomorrow
for people to discuss the Blue Line events today and how the MBTA/Massachusetts
government can better coordinate unplanned shuttle services (such as
implementing bus lanes, having police enforce bus lanes, traffic signal
priority, etc).

TLDR; if the train is late or had major AC issues should they waive the fair?
This morning at least 4 of the 8 cars on my commuter rail had no AC and two were
actually stuck with their heat on. One of the conductors was apologetic and did
not collect tickets.  It was ungodly hot in the heated cars and barely
survivable in the non AC.    The cars with AC were jammed with 3 to a seat and
the aisles full.  A conductor in the AC car was really bothered so many people
were standing in the aisles and pushed her way through collecting tickets
continuously telling people they had to pay even if there was no AC and they
should not be in the aisles, move to the other cars. She was checking passes
even as we rolled into Ruggles and folks were trying to exit.    Brings up the
question, if it’s super hot (with heat on) or you have major delays, should the
conductor have the ability to waive fair collection?

All the green line trains are standing by bc of the incident at Park St. which
isn’t a new thing, delays and hold ups happen.  My problem is that while the
entire green line is on standby and held up waiting at stations, they refuse to
close the doors. Now the entire car’s AC has leaked out and it’s just as hot in
the car as it is on the platform. I politely asked the T operator if he could
close the doors but he said he isn’t allowed to close any doors while waiting on
the platform.  Adding insult to injury now I’m delayed and sweating smh.

Here's some pics from my recent trip to Boston last week!  1. Fitchburg Line at
Waltham  I took the Commuter Rail a total of four times going in and out of the
city from Waltham. The train was late by 5 min and 25 min the two times going
into the city, but they always departed from North Station on time. The trains
were fast, clean, and the seats were very comfortable, just as good as NJ
Transit's trains (coming from a guy from NJ). The ticket app on my phone was
also really easy to use.  2. Red Line at Harvard  I didn't see any of the newer
trains for some reason but these old ones were nice as well. I considered going
all the way down to Ashmont to ride the Mattapan Line but I unfortunately didn't
have the time so I got off at South Station.  3. Green Line (B) at Blandford
Street  I like how many of the Green Line trains mix and match the two cars, so
sometimes the two cars are the same and sometimes they're not.  4. Acela at
South Station  I didn't get to go on the Acela coming to Boston, and I had to
suffer in the dreadful I-95 traffic all the way there. But the day will come...
5. Green Line (D) at Brookline Village  The train was incredibly packed since
this was during rush hour, and the stopping and starting was kind of rough at
times. I tried my best not to fall down, and many others tried as well. Still
the train was pretty fast and I liked how this branch of the Green Line was not
street running.  6. Orange Line at Community College  I love the Orange Line.
The new trains are very cool, and the train goes surprisingly fast at some
parts. It's probably my favorite of all the MBTA lines I went on during my trip.
7. Green Line (E) at Riverway  I didn't get to go on this one, but I had to
unfortunately watch this poor little train get stuck trying to make a left turn
for around 3 minutes. I could do nothing but watch as more and more cars got
backed up behind it. I bet the train dreams of grassy tracks and signal
priority...  8. Bus 61 at Waltham  Going back to my hotel in Waltham, the train
was delayed a little bit at the single-track part, which meant it was going to
be a tight connection to the 61 bus at the station. I had to SPRINT as fast as I
could from the outbound platform to the bus, but I luckily made it. I didn't
have any pictures of the outside of the bus, but I am so thankful that it's
there, since it got me to the hotel for just $1.70 instead of the $20+ I would
have to probably pay for an Uber.  9. All my Charlies!  I absolutely adore the
design of the CharlieCard, it's really unique and I love the story behind it as
well. Also yes, I forgot that you could use your phone to pay at the turnstile,
so I had to buy a CharlieTicket each time. At least they make for some great
souvenirs!  And if you're wondering about the Blue Line... yes, I know it
exists, but a big part of it was closed when I went. But still, the next time I
go to Boston, I'm going to Wonderland...  That's all, folks! Thanks for reading
about my Boston trip, it was so much fun and I love the MBTA! :D

Title: MBTA Green Line C Branch construction to begin this fall, bringing ADA upgrades and major disruptions to Beacon Street

&gt;The MBTA is slated to start construction on the Green Line C Branch as early
as September. The [Green Line accessibility
project](https://brookline.news/mbtas-green-line-accessibility-project-will-consolidate-stops-in-brookline/) will
elevate and widen platforms to ensure that street-level stations comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).   The project will eliminate the Kent
Street stop and consolidate Brandon Hall and Fairbanks Street into one, adding a
new ADA-accessible ramp and a new crosswalk across the elevated section of
Beacon Street.  &gt;The [source of
funding](https://brookline.news/mbta-will-use-federal-grant-to-make-14-green-line-stations-more-accessible-including-nine-in-brookline/)—the
All Stations Accessibility Program, part of the Biden-era Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law passed in 2021—could explain the project’s quick start.
&gt;“\[The T\] already got federal funding…they want to spend it before anything
else happens to it, I’m assuming,” Aaron Norris, senior economic development and
long-term planner told the Brookline Economic Development Advisory Board (EDAB)
in a June 2 meeting.   The T told [Brookline.News](http://Brookline.News) that
it “has contingency plans in place” to ensure projects are “not impacted by any
delays,” while it coordinates with the Federal Transit Administration.  &gt;The
Brookline [Bridle Path
project](https://brookline.news/town-readies-a-major-step-forward-on-beacon-street-bridle-path/) team
has said it is working closely with the T to ensure that adding a bike and
pedestrian path down the Beacon Street median will still be possible after
completion of the C Line project.

Worcester line in &amp; dont want a ton of travel time in the city so beaches
around the north shore or further out aren't possibilities.   Posts have
mentioned the red line being difficult with delays, so im hesitant to go to
beaches on the line like carson. The closest option for us would be constitution
beach along the bl with a simple transfer at gov center. Im not sure i want to
bet on the headways not being an issues on the gl but if its better than the
red, id reluctantly do it. Water quality isnt a concern since we won't be
swimming. Are my needs too difficult to meet?

I have noticed that there hasn’t been much of an update on testing of Phase 2 of
the new Charlie system in over 6 months, Phase 2 of the Better Bus Network,
Phase 2 of the Columbus Avenue busway, or many other projects that the MBTA has
planned.  I know a lot of it is simply not having any funding to continue
projects such as the Arborway Bus Garage, but the Charlie System testing should
have started by now and everyone in the test group should have received their
new CharlieCard. It just feels like the MBTA should be trying better to update
the public on where projects stands and any delays/issues they have been facing
lately.

the end of 2026.   *ALTERNATIVE SERVICES*  * Shuttles buses are in place between
JFK/UMass and Braintree. All Red Line services will be rerouted to Ashmont
during this closure; passengers must transfer to shuttle buses at JFK/UMass.  *
The Commuter Rail will be free at JFK/UMass, Quincy Center, and Braintree during
this closure.  **GREEN LINE**   * Green Line services will be suspended between
**North Station, Kenmore, Heath Street (E Branch ONLY) and Babcock Street (B

additional stop at Back Bay Station for connections to the Orange Line and
Commuter Rail. D Branch services towards Riverside and C Branch service towards
Cleveland Circle resumes at Kenmore. B Branch service towards Boston College
resumes at Babcock Street. All stations west of Kenmore will be fare-free in
both directions.   * Bus Route 57 will provide extra service between Packard’s
Corner and Kenmore. Bus Route 39 will replace E Branch service between Copley

I love trains but over one weekend you miss one Amtrak, and the next one’s an
hour later.  The worker goes on lunch break, then complains you took to long
after missing a train to move your ticket to the next one, even though they went
on break so you can’t do anything until 30 minutes later (and they gaslight you
that they weren’t on break after the first traineven though you have proof).
Plus the whole reason your late is your green line is running 10 minutes slower
than usual cause a girl lost her wallet, and then they express two stops but
wait for 5 minutes before doing that for some reason.  Then you try to get on
the green line the next day, they say the train is full so you go to the next
one and they close the door on you even though you can squeeze in that one.
This is just one weekend but if there’s not a lot of little things. Most would
turn most people off the second they give trains a try (and who are
inexperienced so don’t know the little things to be careful for). I know I would
have in the past, but I’m to much a fan of what they do for a city.  Will say I
was able to get my ticket moved, but not after needing to call customer service.
Edit: then my train stays put for a while cause of a delay. Then switches to
express so I have to get off early. Then the next one that comes is express too.
Come on now

waiting for the D train, which was parked outside the station. Instead of trying
to fix the door problem for 20 minutes, the inspectors cleared out the E train
and got everyone onto another E train, which was coming right behind it and
stopped on the opposite track. Perhaps it was a planned move and the first train
had been having problems previously. But it was a seamless operation that took
maybe 10 minutes total.   People mention lengthy Green Line delays here
semi-frequently, but the T was prepared for this breakdown and did a good job
getting traffic moving again.

Title: The MBTA's "soft cost" crisis

Author: ToadScoper (ID: t2_ab87r37)

The MBTA is in the midst of an underdiscussed long-brewing crisis—not just in
terms of funding shortfalls, state of repair, or service disruptions, but in how
it manages and spends money on capital projects. Specifically, the agency
suffers from a “soft cost” crisis (and by extension, a "status quo" issue) that
continues to erode its ability to deliver timely, cost-effective improvements.
Soft costs—expenses not tied to direct construction like design, permitting,
management, and engineering—have ballooned to comprise 30–50% of total project
budgets in many MBTA initiatives. These excessive costs are driven by redundant
planning stages, lack of standardized designs, siloed consultant contracts, and
a fragmented delivery structure. Yet despite this being a known problem for
years, the MBTA has not made any meaningful structural reforms to address
it—even as its funding outlook worsens. This is far from an issue unique to the
T (it's indicative of the bureaucratic contracting industry), but that doesn't
mean nothing should be done.  This dysfunction is especially evident in station
reconstruction projects. Natick Center Station has been under construction since
2020, originally estimated at $36 million over 30 months. Five years later, it’s
still incomplete, plagued by delays from scope changes and supply chain issues.
Lynn Station, one of the busiest commuter rail stops, was shut down in 2022 and
isn’t expected to be rebuilt until 2030. South Attleboro Station has been
indefinitely postponed. And at the Newton stations (Newtonville, West Newton,
and Auburndale), the MBTA is now only committing to 400-foot platforms—too short
for full-length trains—despite budgets comparable to what used to pay for full
reconstructions. The scope shrinkage and delay are symptoms of a deeper issue:
full station reconstructions at the T are now too expensive and too
administratively complex to be pursued at scale under current practices. This
dysfunction extends beyond stations; the South Coast Rail project is another
glaring example of poor delivery coordination, most of which is tied to the
station construction.  [The proposed \\"tiny\\" Newtonville station will cost
$50 million. By comparison, Natick Center is being reconstructed to full-length
standards for $40
million.](https://preview.redd.it/v6xar38wbsze1.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6fd75912baae47dbd5b996eb86181f85e6e11b)
Meanwhile, a broader backslide in modernization is underway. The MBTA recently
confirmed that Regional Rail modernization will no longer be part of the next
commuter rail operations contract. This reverses prior plans to use a
public-private delivery partnership (PDP) model that would have bundled
operations and capital improvements under one unified agreement. While the MBTA
still intends to pursue Regional Rail as some form of P3, there is no clear
structure or schedule, and this decoupling introduces new risks. Given the T’s
recent fare system modernization fiasco—a troubled P3 with Cubic that has gone
years over schedule and hundreds of millions over budget—the agency must proceed
with caution. If poorly managed, a new Regional Rail P3 could replicate those
failures on a larger scale.  While the MBTA clearly needs new revenue to sustain
and modernize its system, addressing soft costs and reforming project delivery
is one of the few tangible steps it can take immediately, without waiting on
Beacon Hill. For instance, as a model, Phoenix’s Valley Metro light rail system
has consistently delivered extensions on time and under budget. This success is
due to its centralized project delivery authority, design-build procurement
model, and disciplined scope control. Of course, Phoenix’s transit system is
smaller and less complex than Boston’s—but its institutional design and project
culture show that American cities *can* build efficiently with the right
framework.  While soft cost reform is urgent, the question of *how* to implement
it remains. The easy answer would be to bring much of this work
in-house—planning, engineering, and project management—much like New York’s MTA
has done in recent years to reduce its reliance on consultants and regain
control over capital delivery. However, the MBTA currently lacks the
institutional capacity, staffing levels, and pay competitiveness to make this
model feasible in the short term. Building that internal capability would take
years of hiring, training, and structural reform. In the interim, the MBTA must
focus on attainable reforms: adopting design-build delivery, standardizing
project elements like station layouts, reducing customization, and publishing
transparent cost breakdowns. These steps alone could significantly reduce soft
costs while laying the groundwork for a stronger in-house culture over time.
Ultimately, the MBTA does need more funding—that's the easy answer—but it also
needs to prove it can manage that funding responsibly. Soft cost reform is one
of the few levers it can pull in the immediate term without waiting on Beacon
Hill. That means at the very least adopting standardized station templates,
implementing design-build delivery, consolidating oversight, and making cost
breakdowns fully transparent to the public.  Until then, capital improvements
will remain stuck in planning purgatory, and the MBTA will struggle to build the
modern transit system Greater Boston deserves. Damn I should have put all this
on Substack.

Title: Shitty communication by Needham CR stranding me at Ruggles

Post ID: 1khfi9m

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, sorry for emphasis caps but I'm still stranded so on mobile and don't
know how to italics or bold on my phone. Ik those are easier on the eyes.
EDIT: I want to point out that I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast when I
started typing at 9:45 so I might have been overreacting a bit emotionally
speaking, though I stand by every suggestion I made originally, except the need
for a refund — the tickets stay active long enough that I didn't need another to
get home.   So I'd just been waiting 30 mins at Ruggles for the delayed (police
activity) Needham train. Huge Providence (I thought they were also Needham at
first) crowd was waiting for their train too, (probably) drunk after the Sox
game. Three important details:  1. The screen on the side did NOT say Needham
Heights, just had the T logo.  2. No Providence train was announced on the PA
nor shown on the platform screen, so I had no reason to think these people were
trying to go elsewhere.  3. This train, as it often does throughout the day,
said track 1 but pulled up on the track 3 side (same center platform at
Ruggles). I'm used to this the few times I've taken Needham instead of D line it
tends to do this, but I bet it contributed to Providence thinking it was their
train. (Give an announcement about a track change it's not that hard)  So the
Providence crowd rushed to the door and then the flow of people stopped, the
conductor said something to people up front but didn't speak loudly enough over
the chatty Providence crowd so I didn't hear the issue until he finally spoke up
AS THE FUCKING TRAIN WAS ALREADY MOVING, the issue being that these people
weren't going to Needham and the conductor assumed there was no one for Needham
out of earshot waiting his turn to get on the train (I didn't want to be that
guy who shoves to the front just in case but i sure will be from now on, if you
see me and think it's rude you can blame Keolis) and I said "wait is this
Needham and why are you leaving I didn't know I had to push through I need to
get on" and he said "gotta wait for the next one," which is a fucking 11pm
forest hills transfer.  First and foremost, they gotta fix the screens to say
the destination or they can simply wait to move the train until everyone knows
why the crowd halted. I thought we were all getting on this train because NOBODY
MENTIONED A PROVIDENCE TRAIN ON THE PA OR PLATFORM SCREENS.   The conductor
shouldn't trust a drunk Providence crowd coming from a Sox game to convey the
message to everyone else in time. THIS ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE
SCREEN WORKED, THEN NO PROVIDENCE CROWD WOULD HAVE BLOKED ME FROM EARSHOT IN THE
FIRST PLACE.   If typing the final destination into those screens is so damn
hard, then they should stop the 3mph train for me when the problem results from
their poor communication. Do not strand me for an hour at 10pm. Common sense
dictates that when there's a big crowd stretching back 30 feet from the
entrance, not everyone is gonna hear you unless you yell. Conductor should do
his job and CONDUCT the flow of people. Yes I know they were running late. But
the police activity isn't my fault, I was low key tempted to jump on while it
was slowly moving and cause some more police activity when they'd have escorted
me off (intrusive thoughts did not win, obviously). I wasn't late, I was 10 mins
early. I shouldn't wait another hour for Keolis's idiocy.  Also how can I get a
refund on the ticket I activated like it says to on the platform? Cause there's
no way I'm paying for another tonight.

I was at back bay today to catch the 6:45 on the Worcester line. The train
showed up 20 minutes late. No updates or announcements. This is basically a
repeat of what happened in January. Idk why it has to be this specific train
that has issues, but its getting out of hand. I hope keolis dosent get the
contract next year. Seriously though, communicate with people so we know what's
happening. If people leave the platform to get answers from the lobby, they risk
missing the train. We were stopped in Newton to let a train pass &amp; they
communicated with us about that. Yea we were delayed another 15+ mins, but we
were kept in the loop about it. It makes a difference, believe me.

SCR / Fall River/New Bedford lines came out, it's  also struck me as interesting
as to how the admin are going about this rollout. The odd East Taunton shuttle

I live around the corner from a glx station, which can be convenient in terms of
physical proximity to a station. But between delays, inaccurate arrival times
and train traffic, it’s usually way faster and reliable to walk 20 minutes to a
red line station. That or just bus/bike/walk to where i’d need to go. For
something that took forever and cost billions it seems like the cost and time
investment to build it was not worth it, and it just gave  landlords in the area
an excuse to jack up rents for something that is barely useable. Curious what
other people think!

Because of my class time and length of my commute to my college, if I take a
certain train I can only be *just* in time or late depending on delays. If it's
more than 5 or 10 minutes late repeatedly, I will have to take an earlier train
on the schedule. Last semester I was taking a slightly later train and on
Wednesdays it was often delayed by half an hour or even a whole hour so I just
want to know if all the morning trains are that bad on other days besides
Wednesday.

I take the Mattapan trolley, then I transfer at Ashmont station to get downtown.
I've used the shuttle buses in the past, and I know they will eventually get
shuttle trains set up. But since I have to transfer, it's time consuming.   Are
there alternative routes that would save a little bit of time? If so, what would
you recommend? Google maps gave some suggestions that would take 1 hr and 15
mins to get downtown (like taking a bus and then getting on the orange line)  I
have a car and a Dorchester parking permit, if that helps  Edit for clarity: the
Mattapan Trolley will also be using shuttle buses   Edit for how to today went:
Morning commute - left a little after 7am, waited about 5 mins for the shuttle
bus, got on the shuttle bus for about 10 mins to Mattapan, walked from Mattapan
to Blue Hills Ave (about a 12 min walk) for the 7:36am train, took the train to
South Station with ETA of 8:05, then maybe a 7 min walk to work. Overall, about
1 hour commute. Stress free and no delays.  Afternoon commute - left work around
4:35pm, got to South Station for the 4:47pm Readville train, got off at Morton
Street around 5:05pm. Figured I would walk (about 30 mins) since it's so
beautiful out. Walked about 7 mins and I saw a blue bike station with ebikes!
hopped on the ebike for about 10 mins then walked home for another 5 mins or so
with ETA of 5:25pm. Overall about a 45 min commute. Stress free and no delays
again, I'm thankful because my coworkers said the redline was horrid today!

Title: How much of the Old Colony mainline could be double-tracked for cheap? How much would it cost to do the entire thing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the new South Coast Rail schedules releasing, it's clear that trying to run
four Commuter Rail branches through the largely single-tracked Old Colony
mainline is not good for frequency or operations. Delays on one line could and
likely will impact other lines, and the Kingston/Greenbush lines have taken a
frequency hit with the new schedules. With South Coast Rail unfunded and
seemingly unlikely to happen anytime soon, it seems like double-tracking part or
all of the bottleneck could help mitigate some of these problems (and even if
SCR Phase 2 actually did happen, the pre-existing lines could still use some
relief, especially if a Middleboro/Lakeville Cape Cod extension ever happened in
some future lifetime).  Considering this, I pose a couple questions:  * Is it
feasible for the MBTA to build a single additional siding in a key location that
could fit one full-length train (let's say somewhere between Wollaston and
Quincy Adams) for a relatively low cost? Does such a site exist?  * How much
would it actually cost to do the whole thing, by whatever approach is the
cheapest (whether that be land acquisition, tunneling, dropping the number of
lanes on adjacent streets, or reconfiguring the RL between the Ashmont-Braintree
split and JFK so both branches run on the same tracks until the split and giving
the extra tracks to the CR)? Would you expect this to be a somewhat approachable
cost or would it end up being another huge project?

The GLX branches often struggle to meet their stated frequencies of every 6-8
minutes, partially due to congestion in the central GL subway. Considering that
the service is in theory a very useful link that likely could support more
ridership if people could actually rely on it, is there any chance that the MBTA
could short-turn additional trains to run just along the GLX and increase
frequency? Looking at the track map, it seems like it could be possible to short
turn them just after Science Park/West End (allowing for a transfer to a
throughrunning train from the other GLX branch at Lechmere or Science Park) or
at Government Center (using the Brattle Loop, I believe), or some of both.  Even
just a couple more single-car Green Line trains running in this type of
short-turn pattern at a time could increase frequency and capacity when the GLX
needs it the most, without trying to force more trains through the central
subway or allowing delays further down the line to totally shut down service.
Any thoughts?

Much has been said about the adverse effect of signal issues and trains
breakdowns on delays and inconsistent headways on the red line. However, another
major contributor is the fact that the T somehow cannot manage to run trains at
consistent speeds, with trains randomly stopping in between stations or randomly
holding at stations, even in the absence of signal or train issues. There have
been countless times when I boarded a train with the next one 5+ mins behind me,
only for it to catch up with my train by the time I get down at my station. Why
can't the T run trains consistently in the absence of equipment problems? I'm
endlessly grateful for Eng's focus on fixing the equipment, but I feel that
operational aspects should also be improved.

**ORANGE LINE**  *North Station to Jackson Square*  WHEN: March 1st-2nd  WHY:
Critical signal work that will allow service to run more frequent and prevent
delays due to signal issues.  ALTERNATIVE SERVICE: Shuttle buses will replace
service at Back Bay, Mass. Ave, Ruggles, Roxbury Crossing, and Jackson Sq.
Green Line service replaces downtown service between Copley and North Station.
- NOTE 1: Inbound (towards downtown Boston and Union Sq., Medford/Tufts, and
Government Center) Green Line service at Copley will be free. Service will be
free at Jackson Square for continued Orange Line service towards Forest Hills.
Orange Line service resumes at North Station for service towards Oak Grove.   -
NOTE 2: Commuter Rail service will be free on the Needham Line at South Station,
Back Bay, Ruggles, and Forest Hills. Bus Route 39 and 1, as well as the E Branch
of the Green Line also provides good alternative service for stations that are
closed.   *North Station to Oak Grove*  WHEN: Beginning March 7th at 8:30 PM and
continuing the weekend of March 8-9th.  WHY: MassDOT bridge work near Sullivan
Square on Maffa Way. This will repair the bridge and provide new bus/bike lanes
and other infrastructure improvements near Sullivan Square.   ALTERNATIVE
SERVICE: Shuttle buses replaces service for all stops between Oak Grove and
North Station. Express buses will stop at Oak Grove, Malden Center, and North
Station. No free Haverhill CR Line service due to the MassDOT work.   **RED
LINE**  *JFK/UMass to Braintree*  WHEN: The weekends of March 8-9th, 22nd-23rd,
and 29-30th.   WHY: Critical signal work that will allow service to run more
frequent and prevent delays due to signal issues.  ALTERNATIVE SERVICE: Shuttle
buses replaces service for all stops on the Braintree Branch. Free
Middleborough/Lakeville, Kingston, and Greenbush CR Lines service at South
Station, JFK/UMass, Quincy Center, and Braintree.   **BLUE LINE**  *Station
Closure: Bowdoin*  WHEN: Starting March 7th and 21st at 7 PM and continuing all
day from March 8-10th and March 22nd-24th.  WHY: Maintenance work at the
station.  ALTERNATIVE SERVICE: Passengers may walk to the Bowdoin area from
Government Center, where Blue Line trains will terminate during the station
closure period. Passengers may also walk from Charles/MGH Station on the Red
Line.   - NOTE: Passengers should expect slightly decreased train service during
the station closure period.

I take the green line (B branch) to and from school/work. I feel like at least
once every week or two there will be a “signal problem” that delays trains by
20+ minutes. What is it? And why does it keep happening?

These past few weeks commuting on the red line between Harvard and Charles have
been brutal. So many times the train has just been stopped for 10 minutes with
little explanation but “we are stopped and will move when the dispatcher says
it’s okay.” Is this all because of signal issues at Harvard? I’ve been looking
around for some kind of game plan to address this, but don’t see anything - does
anyone have insight into the plan to address this?   Also as a quick sidenote,
when they say they are “expecting delays of xx minutes”, does that mean a delay
of xx minutes from end to end of the line?

My four hours of MBTA Saturday.  Each of these annoyances is trivial.  It’s the
sheer volume of minor annoyances that add up to, “Close Enough For Government
Work”.  ·       With two people waiting on the platform at Waban, a car 3698
marked “Union Station” sails right through without stopping.  ·       Three
minutes later, another single car 3844 stops.  The fare box isn’t working.  This
is not uncommon.  Why don’t they take cars with bad fare boxes out of service? 
How are they going to enforce payment with cars like 3844.  ·       When I get
to GovCen, I see 8-10 people waiting at the non-revenue loop track.  I point
them to the correct track for a train to Copley.  This is the second time this
month I have seen people waiting in this spot.  There should be an eye-level
sign saying that trains do not stop here.  Also, it is not uncommon for patrons
to wait for a train at Park Street, track 3.  ·       Later, at Park Street, I
see a woman wearing a Bruins shirt.  She fails to board a Medford bound train. 
Why? The T helper in the red shirt had told her to take a Union Square train to
North Station.  ·       Keep in mind that there are eleven stops north of Park
Street and the “E” train goes to ten of them.  Today, a train on track 4 at Park
Street arrived with a destination of “E Heath Street”.  This happens all too
frequently leaving many patrons on the platform baffled.
https://preview.redd.it/kglc3u4t7ffe1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7acf2f7da7fecc4d379907beea03724af7e8da68
·       This is followed by a train with a destination of “E Union Square” which
leaves me baffled.  ·       Later, I’m at Kenmore trying to get to Copley.  A
GovCen train arrives on the “B” track.  It’s packed , but fails to close its
doors and depart.  Three minutes later, a Union Square train arrives on the C/D
track.  Both trains kill another 3 minutes by exchanging drivers as well as
destinations.  The “new” GovCen train departs first.  All too often, I find that
the inbound trains at Kenmore do not leave in the order they arrive, often with
one being detained for several minutes.  Two week ago, they held a C train in
the station which prevented my D train from entering the station.  Four minutes
later a B train arrived and departed before the other two.  ·       Later, at
Hynes, I’m trying to get home.  Two Riverside trains are due in 11 and 13
minutes.  When the first car arrived, it is empty and does not stop, which means
that the next car would be a standing-room-only single.  ·       Half-way
between Hynes and Kenmore, there is an always-red-with-a-24-second-delay
signal.  One train this day slowed, then passed the red signal 2 seconds before
it would have turned green.

I've been going over a variety of different ways for City of Malden residents to
get to Downtown Boston from Malden Center Station.  I came up with several and
want to get your thoughts and opinions on alternatives as well.  First Option:
Take Route 105 To Sullivan and take the orange line from there.  Take the 104 to
Airport station, catch the Blue Line to Government Center or Bowdoin Station and
walk from there.  Take same route 104 to Airport and hop on the SL3 to go
non-stop to South station.  Take New Route 96 when Implemented to Union Square
and Take Green Line D to Haymarket, Government or Park Street Stations.  Take
the 92 or 93 to Downtown once arrived at Sullivan Station.  When implemented,
take the 7 which will be 15 minutes or better every day Monday through Sunday
into Downtown from Sullivan.  Take the Red Line from Davis or Porter  Those are
my options.  If you guys come up with any more ideas just to help them out, when
the orange line is down for delays or an emergency.  post them in the comments.
because we all need to travel no matter how far away we live.  Peace and Love.

The train signage says "every 12 to 20 minutes".   There are speakers at the

So after 25 minutes, I find the above online.  That's fine and all, bit what
about people who can't read (they're out there)?  Old people with no cell
phones?  Blind people?  CAN THE MBTA PLEASE HAVE ANMOUNCEMENTS OVER THEOR
GODDAMN SPEAKERS?????  I went upstairs and talked to a red jacket rep who looked
at me like I had three heads when I mentioned to him that as there are three
dozen people who have been waiting downstairs for over 25 minutes, that perhaps
someone should maybe GO TELL THEM????    People have appointments to get to and
families to go home to.    It's just simply unacceptable.  So I called customer
service, explaining the above.  However, I also asked them when the turnaround
would be for the response.  They asked for my name and my number, and gave it to
them.    I'd really like to talk to them and see what they have to say.

TL;DR - Any public meetings delayed until next year, no further details likely
until then.   Hi u/sirgeorgington,   Thank you for your interest in the Roxbury
Resilient Corridors project. We are working on getting all the paperwork needed
to receive the funding ($20 M) from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). It
has taken much longer than expected, but the consultant team we have
preselected, Rivera Consulting, is ready to start when these funds are obligated
to the City (likely around January).  You are correct in that there haven't been
any public meetings yet. We have updated the website to reflect that the project
will be starting in full next Spring. The team has also updated the
project-specific email where you can reach the Project Manager directly:
roxburycorridors@boston.gov. We encourage you to ask any additional questions
and stay engaged. However, note that we don't anticipate starting community
engagement until the early Spring.   Lastly, since we are still in the midst of
the contracting process, we are unable to share any proposals. Once the
contracting is complete, these proposals will be part of the City's public
documents, and we'll be happy to share the selected team's proposal with you.

I sometimes use Worcester line of the commuter rail to go to Boston and back

noticed that there have been a LOT of delays over the past few months -- inbound
train arrive at my station 5-10 minutes late, and outbound train leaves South
Station 10 minutes late or more. (It happened again today.) The trip itself
takes longer as well. In the past, inbound trains arrived at most 1-2 minutes
late, and for 5pm outbound trains, they were always ready at 4:50pm and left at
5pm straight. If this continues, I might as well consider taking the green line
instead, which actually gives me more flexibility in the schedule.  Are my
observations correct? What is the reason for these delays?

I could just post wtf? and anyone who’s tried to rely on this train would know

By the time it reaches Swampscott (my stop) it’s between 10-15 minutes behind
schedule, and the delays seem to start as soon as it leaves Newburyport.   What
puzzles me is that the schedule was recently changed to have the train leave 5
minutes earlier, but that has done nothing to improve things.   I realize this
won’t solve the problem, but if anyone has any ideas into why this seems to be a
feature, rather than a bug, it might help restore some small amount of sanity
when I’m pissing the morning away on a cold platform.

Title: My Full Review of MBTA Route 109 — Harvard Square to Linden Square (Malden)

Author: Miserable-Part6261 (ID: t2_ds3eoslf)
Posted: 2025-11-04 21:40:29 UTC
Post ID: 1ook702

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 109 is one of those under the radar MBTA routes that doesn’t always get
talked about, but it quietly does a lot. Starting right in **Harvard Square**,
it connects one of the busiest Red Line hubs to a chain of neighborhoods and
cities - Somerville, Everett, and eventually **Malden’s Linden Square** \- that
don’t otherwise have many direct cross-town links. I decided to ride it from
Harvard Square, with plans to go all the way to Linden, though I got off around
**Union Square in Somerville** to see how the route handled that stretch. Even
just that segment gave me a solid impression of what the 109 brings to the
table.  # The Ride Experience  Pulling out of Harvard Square Busway is always a
bit of a crawl. the mix of pedestrians, cyclists, and tight turns through the
tunnel can slow any bus to a near stop. But once you’re past the heart of
Harvard and moving along the Somerville line, the ride smooths out. The scenery
changes fast. one minute it’s college row and street performers, the next it’s
neighborhood storefronts, corner markets, and a real “local-bus” vibe.  What
surprised me most was how **connected** this route feels. It’s not just a local
shuttle between squares - it’s a **cross-city connector** that quietly ties
together major urban corridors. If you didn’t want to deal with transferring
underground between the Red Line and Orange Line, this bus essentially bridges
that gap on the surface. You can hop on at Harvard and, without switching modes,
reach Somerville, Everett, and Malden in one Ride.  Even though I exited at
Union Square, I could tell from the schedule and map that the rest of the ride
toward Linden Square gives access to multiple neighborhood centers that have
grown denser in recent years. For commuters, students, and people running
errands, that kind of surface-level connectivity matters more than most realize.
# Comfort &amp; Performance  The bus itself was in good condition. clean
interior, decent temperature, and a smooth ride despite city traffic. The bus
operator handled the route confidently, even through tight turns and light
congestion. Traffic between Inman Square and Union Square can test anyone’s
patience, but the driver kept things calm and steady.  Where things could be
better is **schedule consistency**. The timetable looks neat on paper, but
real-world headways can stretch longer than posted, especially during evening
peaks. You’ll often see a gap of 20 minutes, then two buses arrive close
together. that bunching effect that’s all too familiar across the system.  #
Speed &amp; Reliability  Once you’re out of Harvard’s bottleneck, the 109 moves
fairly well, but the route could benefit from **transit priority improvements**.
Signal priority and short stretches of **dedicated bus lanes**, especially near
Union Square and key intersections in Everett, would easily shave 5–8 minutes
off trips and make it far more predictable.  The MBTA’s recent experiments with
transit-signal upgrades on similar routes (like the 39 and 66) show that these
tweaks work. If the 109 got the same treatment, riders would notice immediately.
# Suggestions &amp; Improvements  If I could change a few things about Route
109, I’d start with three:  1. **Evening Service and Frequency**  \- More
evening trips from Harvard (past 9 p.m.) would make a big difference for shift
workers and riders catching the Red Line home. Right now, service tapers off
just when nightlife and late shifts pick up. 2. **Stop Visibility and Signage**
\- In parts of Somerville, especially around Union Square, some stops are hard
to spot or unmarked due to construction and detours. Clearer signage or
electronic displays would help new riders immensely. 3. **Real-Time Tracking
Accuracy** \- The countdown apps and trackers for this route can be hit-or-miss.
When they’re off by more than 5 minutes, people lose trust and resort to
guessing. Better synchronization with GPS pings would fix that quickly.  # Final
Thoughts  Even though I didn’t ride all the way to Linden Square this time, I
can see the 109’s potential as a **true cross-metro corridor**. It’s a
working-class, practical, community-focused route - not flashy, but essential.
It lets you watch the transition from Cambridge’s academic bustle to
Somerville’s neighborhood life and onward toward Malden’s suburban edge - all in
one continuous line.  With a few operational improvements and clearer rider
information, the 109 could easily stand shoulder-to-shoulder with higher-profile
routes like the 1 or 66. It’s a route that deserves more recognition and
investment, not just as a connector, but as a reliable everyday bridge between
Boston’s inner-core communities.

So I applied to a few jobs at MBTA over the past month. First one I applied to
relatively late in the window, got a rejection email right after it closed.
Shortly after, I saw two more job postings I had relevant experience for open
up, so I applied to both of those too.  Both of these jobs had the same closing
date last week and one of them sent me a rejection letter next day like the
first one did. However, I have not heard back from the other one I applied to,
and this is the one my experience matches more closely.  I've heard people say
the hiring process can be kinda slow, and I've seen a couple commentors say it's
sometimes worth reaching out to HR back. I'm curious about how long you should
wait before this is worth doing (it's only been a little bit under a week so
far) and how you should do it (call, email, in-person). I'm also wondering if
there's anything else I should make sure I'm ready for / checking for (know
people have talked about screening calls, do those get scheduled by email ahead
of time or are they cold calls?).

Okay, hear me out internet.  Slow zones are fixed.  The T has its issues, but I
think anyone who grew up here can agree that the T is running about as well as
it ever has and in some places its running better than it ever did.  With the
new signal systems, new trains and Eng at the helm, the future looks bright as
long as the money keeps coming in. What helps money? Ridership!  **The T needs
to promote the current state of affairs.** I think tons of people are stuck in
their ways from the pandemic and have no idea that the T is doing pretty well.
On r/MBTA we're all transit nerds who keep up on the latest developments. Tons
of people got in their cars during Covid, read a couple of headlines in 2023
about the T being fucked and haven't thought about the T or their commute
options since. They're just doing their same old daily routine.  In ancient
decades such as the 1920s-1950s, the BERY and the MTA used to do a lot of
marketing based on travel time.  There would be big signs outside stations
advertising the travel time by train to certain other points.  This needs to
come back.  The billboards downtown by the highway are too vague and
wishy-washy.  The T needs to put its money where its mouth is.  **There should
be a huge billboard on Route 3 somewhere in Braintree that proudly proclaims the
travel time by Red Line from Quincy Adams to South Station.**  If the T really
wanted to show off, they should take the gamble to make it a live display with
the actual current travel time. For 2025 so far, that travel time has averaged
22 minutes.  Driving that stretch during rush hour can easily take an hour. Even
with a bit of walking and parking time, you're talking about saving an hour
every day if you park at Quincy Adams and hop on the T to get downtown instead
of driving the whole way.  **Where else could these go?**  Route 1A near
Wonderland with time to Government Center? 17m on the train vs. 45m driving.
Route 2 before Alewife with time to Park Street? 17m on the train vs. 45m
driving.

Has anyone noticed that they are now adopting the practice of using fewer cars
on the Red Line? The first time I saw this, it was just a novelty, but today it
added ten minutes to my commute. I was trying to transfer from the GL, and since
the center stairs are closed, I had to go to the far end. As I passed the center
stairs (running because I knew from the app that a train was close at hand), I
saw no train in the station, so I was lulled into a false sense of security.
Once I descended the stairs, it took a second for me to notice that the shorter
train was in the station on the far end. I broke into another sprint, but it was
too late. The T employee with the flashlight was signaling the driver to close
the doors, stranding me at Park Street. What’s even more annoying is that the
train before it had left ONE minute earlier, so if it had used common sense and
idled even for two minutes, it would have made for more even distribution
instead of the obvious bunching. Grrr.

"Through the first 12 months of the offering, the share of fares paid using the
“contactless” system grew from less than 10 percent to more than 25 percent.
That’s close to the same share as “stored value” taps, or when a rider puts a
set dollar amount on a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket but does not buy a weekly or
monthly pass. The remaining roughly 50 percent of trips involve those time-based
passes or other options, such as T employees.  So in other words, by late
spring, just about as many riders were turning to Apple Pay, Google Wallet and
credit cards as were loading up their trusty old CharlieCards with a set dollar
amount."

I want to start by saying I love the bus &amp; I appreciate everything the
workers do. I also always try to make it to the stop on time because if I'm late
and miss the bus, that's my fault.  However, I've had a few situations with the
94 where when I'm only a few feet from the stop, waving my arms around and
sprinting, that the drivers look at me and speed away. I've had this happen
occasionally over the past two years living in the area. Sometimes it seems like
the drivers are in a hurry even when they're on time, it's the middle of the day
on a weekend, and the bus is empty. I've also been in the bus and seen the
driver go past people. I submit reports to the MBTA but I'm not sure what the
solution is.  My question is: is there a reason why bus drivers seem to be in a
rush sometimes? Are they trying to get ahead of the schedule because they're
familiar with the traffic patterns? Are they rushing so they can leave early or
take a break?  Being a bus driver is hard and I really appreciate their (perhaps
your!) work but the unreliability is starting to get to me. I could be on time
and visible and still the bus can miss me. That's life I guess!

Let’s bring back the 55’s evening freedom. If you live, work, study, or visit
around Fenway, the West Fens, Copley, or Back Bay, you know how the early cutoff
strands people, forces expensive rides, and makes late appointments, games,
concerts, and shifts harder than they need to be. This petition asks the MBTA to
restore the Route 55’s former service span **through 11:00 p.m.**, so riders can
count on a safe, reliable trip home—without checking the clock every minute.
Here’s why restoring the 11 p.m. end time is simple, fair, and overdue: • safer,
better-lit trips after dark, reducing long walks and costly alternatives; • real
access to evening jobs, classes, medical visits, and events, not just daytime
errands; • stronger connections to Green/Orange Line hubs at Copley/Back Bay,
improving transfers all evening; • equity for seniors, people with disabilities,
hospitality and healthcare workers who rely on late trips; • consistency with
the region’s push for better night service, not cutbacks; • a small scheduling
change with a big quality-of-life payoff for thousands of riders.  Add your
name, add your voice, and share this widely with neighbors, coworkers,
classmates, and local businesses. When we speak up together—politely, clearly,
and persistently—the MBTA listens. **Sign the petition today to restore Route 55
service through 11:00 p.m.**, and let’s make sure our neighborhood has the
evening transit it deserves.

for almost 10 minutes and finally get moving only to then sit at Suffolk Downs
for another 5 minutes.   We’re moving again, thank goodness, but my question is
why can’t the T dole out a couple bucks to have a couple of guys with flags
manually wave trains through each station? It’s not like this was an unforeseen
sudden emergency. This is scheduled work. There should be better planning around
this stuff. I’m now late and the client rescheduled for later this afternoon
which will throw off all my other appointments.   Thanks, MBTA. Thanks for

I'm unfamiliar with Boston's transit system but I enjoy collecting rapid transit
tickets from the late-19th and early 20th century. Here's a 5 cent BERy ticket
from 1898 to 1908. It's undated but mentions William Hooper, who was the
Treasurer at that time according to a 1932 NYT article.   The back says it's an
Employee's Ticket, so I'm curious if the design for passengers looked different.
The other examples of BERy tickets I've seen online are already from the 1920s
to 1950s.

lived in Quincy so we decided to linger over one last drink. We stayed for
another 70 minutes and perhaps collectively spent another $150 at the bar for a
final round. I got an espresso martini I wouldn't have gotten if we all had to

I know that they just started experimenting with later service by extending it

of the busiest lines. I've also been wondering is it even possible? I know they
typically do maintenance through the night, but if these other cities can do it,
why can't we? I feel like it would definitely benefit people who need to stay
out late and work overnight, see games or events that end late, or have a flight
arriving into Logan around 2am and need public transit to get home. Anyone else
feel this way or have an answer why we don't have 24/7 service?

but I wonder how consistently that time is used systemwide. Also they said that
money is another big thing that keeps the mbta from doing it. Other cities
manage to keep some late-night service going while still doing upkeep. Would
love to hear from anyone with inside knowledge or experience on how that

Just so yall know for some pre context. I’m not from Boston or the MBTA area.
Yesterday I was getting on an inbound Newburyport/Rockport line from Salem. I
and many other walked in the last door, the last car closest to the engine which
was a multilevel. As we were boarding, the conductor started yelling at my car
saying “whoever opened this door, you are not allowed to open it, this door is
not manned”. What does that even mean, why are people able to open doors w/o a
key. Are the only doors that open where the conductors are? Where I’m from
(NJT/MTA), every door opens and you just walk on any car that’s opened even if
there’s a conductor or not. Later the conductor apologized to us because she
didn’t know they had electric doors on their set (again what does that mean). So
I’m at a loss. ELI5 please I’m a bit slow. Also why do MBTA conductors rarely
check tickets/check tickets so late.

Using the MBTA's wonderfully documented API v3 (genuinely it's amazing), I've
been working on making this little display for my desk that shows the upcoming
Green Line B trains near my apartment! I haven't finished designing a stand for
it yet, so my RLE mug had to suffice for this demo, but it's most of the way
there, especially software-wise! It can be reconfigured to work with any train
station in the MBTA system, and can show a custom number of pages, filter by
train line, and eventually I want to add time/weather, but that's a future goal.
For the screen, I used an old cash register customer display screen since I
really like the look, and they're super cheap to buy, plus they just use RS-232
internally.  If this is something people would be interested in making/buying,
I'm hoping to publish plans for this one and sesign a version that can be
produced more easily with character LCDs!

Title: "Late Night" CR Service Ends Too Early?

Anyone else think the last CR trains out of Boston leave way too early? If
there's still a bunch of flights arriving into Logan later than midnight,
festivities at TD garden and Fenway that make a bunch of local commuters have to
leave early to catch final the train, and the last train is held anyways on
nights like July 4th and New Years why can't there be more late night service
and the last train doesn't leave until 1 or 2AM? I know that with the short
staffing and single tracking issues there can't be many more trains added to the
schedules, but still there's no reason why the last train should depart so
early. Anyone else agree?

I travel into the city in the mornings on the Orange Line at 557-600am weekdays.
This week things have been incredibly strange. The digital boards and the MBTA
Go app have been missing trains. On Monday morning, I had just missed a train,
which isn’t usually a big deal because they usually run every 4-5 minutes in the
morning, but the app and the boards were saying 10 minutes and 20 minutes for
the next two trains. I got on the next train and the train left within a couple
of minutes WELL before the signs said. This happened this morning as well except
I was on the wrong train. Track 2 was supposed to leave before Track 1 and
admittedly I was very tired this morning and got in the train on Track 2 (but
didn’t notice that only a few people were on my train). I was sitting there and
heard the bell go off and looked and saw the other train leave. I looked at the
app and the times immediately changed and went to an absurdly long time before
the train was supposed to leave on track 2. I always leave lots of extra time
before I actually have to be at work so I wasn’t concerned about being late -
more annoyed. But,  once again, the train left much earlier than the app said it
was supposed to. I don’t get it.   This issue has only been going on this week
and it’s only at Oak Grove. At Back Bay traveling home the schedule is fine.
Anybody know what could be happening? How does one know what schedule the trains
are following?

Hi all,  I’m posting this with a lot of hope and anxiety. Late last night
(around 9:00 p.m., July 8), I lost my dad’s old digital camera on the MBTA Green
Line when I got off a train at Government Center (I already called the help
line)  It’s a small dark grey canon powershot with a silver shutter button, and
it was inside my black/navy blue Lowepro carrying case with a USB drive
attached, and it probably slipped out of my bag or pocket while I was sitting or
getting off the train.  This camera has sentimental photos and memories that
aren’t backed up. I know someone might’ve picked it up, and I don’t care who. I
just want the camera back.  💰 I’m offering a cash reward and no questions
asked—I just really, really want it returned.  If you saw anything, found a
camera, or know someone who did—please reach out. You can DM me here or email me
at sombrerosdetuned@gmail.com  Thank you so much for reading.

Saw this old signage at Maverick on my walk this morning and thought that it
would be a good thing to discuss with the community regarding the persistent
issues many riders have over the MBTA’s lack of updating signage across the
system (which has been improving lately in the Wayfinding Department).  How do
y’all feel about the MBTA’s signage/wayfinding style? I believe someone in the
subreddit said that the Wayfinding Department is actively working on revising
wayfinding with a design firm, so now is a great time to start looking at what
riders would want to see changed.  Also down for anyone interested in providing
history in how the MBTA found their wayfinding style, any documents relating to
it, etc.   I might starting making this a weekly series so that everyone can
learn from each other about the system!

Title: Fairmount Line electrification project- what we know (Summer 2025)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MBTA Fairmount Electrification Project- What we know (Summer 2025)  Here’s what
we know so far about the Fairmount Electrification pilot project which is being
conducted as a P3 with Keolis (not an MBTA project) based on an early June
memorandum.  The project is fully funded, with $11 million of the total $54
million being spent to date. There is still a lot we do not know with this
project, since public transparency regulations do not apply to private
contractors.   Here’s what we know:          •       The MBTA will procure seven
BEMU via a leasing agreement with Keolis.          •       Keolis issued a
Rolling Stock Request for Proposals (RFP) in February 2025, with manufacturer
bids due June 2025 and financing proposals due August 2025.         •       The
MBTA has released a Finance RFP seeking a lessor to purchase the fleet and enter
into a long-term lease agreement with the operator. This lease-structure will be
transferable to future operating contractors.         •       Selection of both
rolling stock and finance partners is expected by Q3 2025, with detailed design
and contract finalization occurring through late 2025 and 2026.         •
Manufacturing will take place in 2027–2028, with field testing and acceptance
occurring throughout 2028. Revenue service will launch upon successful
completion of testing.         •       The system is designed to support
20-minute bi-directional all-day service, enabled by enhanced layover capacity
and battery performance.  Rolling Stock &amp; Infrastructure Design:          •
No mainline overhead catenary will be installed. After dialogue with
manufacturers, Keolis determined that onboard battery capacity will be
sufficient, and no supplemental electrification is required for normal service
or recovery operations. The absence of catenary infrastructure means that
through-service by Amtrak along the Fairmount Line is not planned.         •
Six new electrified layover tracks will be built at Readville, tied into the
larger Widett Circle layover project.         •       A new Light Maintenance
Facility (LMF) will be constructed on an existing MBTA site. The LMF RFP is
anticipated in October 2025 and will provide inspection, cleaning, and routine
servicing capabilities for the BEMU fleet.  $12 Million Track and Right-of-Way
Renewal:          •       A separate, MBTA-funded $12 million capital project
initiated on June 2 will replace all track infrastructure along the Fairmount
Line by Fall 2025.         •       This includes full tie and rail replacement,
ballast rehabilitation, drainage improvements, and signal modernization,
creating conditions necessary for higher-speed, higher-frequency service.
•       The work is intended to eliminate slow orders, improve ride quality, and
prepare the corridor for BEMU testing and operation in 2028.  Rumored or
Speculative Improvements (Not Yet Official):          •       Advocates have
reported that the Fairmount Line platform at Readville may be relocated several
hundred feet north to simplify yard operations and improve ADA access.         •
A rebuild of Fairmount Station, including platform-level adjustments for the
future BEMU fleet.         •       The rolling stock itself is expected to
consist of single-level four-car trainsets with full walk-through gangways,  and
high-level-only boarding.

This came in the last couple of days from both the towns of Bedford and
Lexington, but there will be major changes to 62 and 76 service starting from
late August.  Some major tidbits…  62/76 will be eliminated.  62 and 76 will
operate every 30 minutes during rush hours, meaning 15 minute service in the
shared 62 and 76 portion.  62 will have Sunday service for the first time ever,
mirroring Saturday service, which will be improved to a bus every 50 minutes.
76 will operate weekday middays, but at 90 minute intervals and 76 will no
longer operate on weekends.  MBTA will have official word on this very soon…

Hey all! Hope everyone had a prideful commute this weekend!  I’ve got a question
for fellow disabled riders: is it possible to participate in both the TAP card
program and The RIDE? I’ve had a TAP card for a few years now, but as my
disability worsens in the summer and progresses generally, I’m realizing that
I’m avoiding going to important doctor appointments and getting out of the house
because I can’t reliably make the walks between my place and my stop/station or
between the destination stop/station and where I need to be. Even in weather
that doesn’t make me sick, my max walking time is about 10 minutes (and I take
breaks), but in the hotter and/or more humid weather, it’s impossible. I’m
really afraid of missing an appointment, or getting stuck somewhere when I’m
going to be sick or faint alone.  I have paperwork that the Mobility people sent
me, but it’s confusing as to whether or not they accept people who can
conditionally use public transit. One place in the paperwork said they do, but
another place said that you can appeal it, as though it disqualifies you? Like I
said: confusing. I’m afraid of filling it out incorrectly and getting rejected
because I misunderstood something.  Does anyone have any personal insight? I’m
supposed to be regularly going to PT to improve my health, but if I can’t go, or
if I go and show up late and about to pass out, it’s not a good use of my time
or my PT’s. (It would also be nice to see my friends more often…or leave the
house more than once a week…)  Thanks so much for any help! People have been
great on this subreddit whenever I have a question, and I really appreciate it.

I was looking to get on the t one night at the Boston College stop, I got there
as they were just closing the doors but weren't moving. I was able to get to the
second car before they had moved at all and I motioned to the driver to open the
doors because it didn't look like they were moving anytime soon. She motioned
back that I should go get on the front car so I walked up to the front car and
tried to get the attention of the driver for him to open the door. I fully
knocked but he didn't even make eye contact with me. I stood there for about a
minute to the point where the other people already on the t could hear and see
me asking to get on. Finally the t drives away and as the second car goes by me
the lady driving blows me a kiss. I was appalled, why are they willingly turning
away paying customers? I get it when you get the t stop too late at BC and
they've already started going a little. But this was so clearly not the case
they fully hadn't moved and just didn't want to let me on for some reason? Like
what was the need for the attitude of blowing me a kiss?

I feel like all the lines end just before midnight and none of them run past
midnight. Because of all the activities going on in Boston and the late night
flights coming in from Logan, I feel like service should be increase to at least
1am if not 2am. Like if my flight gets in to Logan after midnight I have no
choice but to drive or have someone pick me up. But for cities like New York or
Chicago service runs past midnight and so I'd have a few options to get home and
I'd be waiting at most and hour or so. Anyone else agree?

This one was removed from the schedule during all the Wincester construction
(along with a bunch of others, such that service is now once every two hours
instead of each hour for the morning/early afternoon). However, it looks like
the new spring 2025 schedule just came out and it doesn't appear to be a

even though construction is complete? Am I doomed to forever coming into work an

Like the title says, I've never used the MBTA before (or any public transport -
I'm from a very rural place with no public transport infrastructure lol).  I
have a few questions about how it works that I couldn't find a definitive answer
for on the website or on Reddit:  1. When you're changing T lines (like red to
green for example) do you have to pay, or because it's in the same station can
you just change over at no extra cost?   2. Are the 1 day passes exactly 24
hours from the time that they're purchased at a kiosk?   3. How much extra time
should I give myself when using the T? I saw a lot of posts talking about how
they're often late and was wondering if there's an average time that they're
late so I can plan accordingly.   4. If I'm leaving MGM Fenway after 10PM (going
to a concert there), about how many T rides are left in the night? I saw that
they usually run until 12:35AM, but I'm curious how many chances I'll have to
get home if I leave the venue later than expected.   Thanks for any help! Other
advice/tips are welcome that aren't answering these specific questions :) also
sorry if these are weird or unanswerable questions to ask lol

pulling up on the wrong platform something that i should prepare for for the

Heyy, so Im moving to Boston later in the year and I have never lived in a big
city before. I have no clue how the MBTA works. Can ya all give me a rundown on
how it works.?  Are the trains normally late, if so which ones are? should I try
and live closer to a train station? Do they run in all hrs of the day ? I am
thinking of living somewhat near the South End or its surrounding neighborhoods
and I will be commuting to Umass Boston. Should I travel on the trains or buses,
is there a crazy difference.?  I would appreciate any help ya all can give me.

Is it just me or has the green line been slow lately? Specifically, the E branch
from tufts to the city in the mornings. It seems like we “stand by” at stops
more and more. Has anyone else noticed this?

**TL;DR at bottom.**  # Subway (April 6)  **Red Line (Before April 30):**  *
From April 1 to April 30, all trains will run from Alewife-Braintree, every 7-8
minutes. Ashmont riders will need to transfer to a shuttle bus from April 1-9,
and a shuttle train from April 10-30.   **Red Line (Starting May 1)**  The
following headways are for the branches (south of JFK). For stations north of
JFK (the trunk), take the numbers and cut them in half.   * Weekday frequencies
will improve from every 12-20 to every 10-16 minutes. * Weekend frequencies will
stay at every 12-16 minutes.  **Note:** The weekday service increases are only
possible because they will be running more 4 car trains, to get higher
frequencies with the limited equipment that they have. The amount of cars in
service will be the same, just spread out over more trains.    **Orange Line:**
* Weekday service improves slightly from every 6-9 to every 6-8 minutes.  *
Saturday Service improves from every 9-10 minutes to every 8-10 minutes (8
during the day, 10 early morning/evenings) * Sunday Service improves from every
12-14 minutes to every 9-11 minutes (every 9-10 during the day, every 10-11
early morning/evenings)     **Blue Line:**  * Some weekday midday trains are
shifted to late nights. (Service will be every 7-8 minutes midday and every
10-12 late night instead of every 6-8 and 10-13, respectively) * Weekend Service
improves from every 9-13 to every 7-10 minutes.    # Bus:  * 70 bus routes + the
Silver line will have service changes. I will only list changes on key bus
routes. For more information on the other routes, go
[here](https://www.mbta.com/service-changes/spring-2025-service-changes).
**1:**  Sunday frequency increases very slightly between 9AM and 6PM.  **22:**
Weekday service frequency increases between 2PM and midnight.  **23:**  Weekday
service frequency increases between 12PM and 9PM.  **32:**  Sunday frequency
increases, weekday trips shift.  **57:**  Most short-turn trips to Oak Square on
weekdays will be extended to Watertown, increasing service on the outer half of
the line. Sunday trips shift.  **66/71/73/111:**  Every day, trips shift.
**77:**  On weekdays, midday service will increase. On weekends, service will
increase to run every 15 minutes or better, all day.  **109:**   One trip is
added on weekdays, going outbound at 5:05 AM.  **116:**  The last trip of the
day will no longer serve State; it will now terminate at Maverick.  **Silver
Line:**  Weekday trips shift. SL4 Service improves slightly on weekdays.    #
Commuter Rail (March 24):  * The [Fall River/New Bedford
Line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/media/route_pdfs/batch_7394/2025-03-24-cr-spring-summer-fall-river-new-bedford-line.pdf)
will open, closing Lakeville Station, and extending all Middleborough trains to
Fall River/New Bedford. *
[Greenbush](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/media/route_pdfs/batch_7394/2025-03-24-cr-spring-summer-greenbush-line.pdf)
and
[Kingston](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/media/route_pdfs/batch_7394/2025-03-24-cr-spring-summer-kingston-line.pdf)
trains will have a completely new schedule, with many trips significantly
shifted around. * The [Newburyport/Rockport
Line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/media/route_pdfs/2025-03-24-cr-newburyport-rockport-line-temporary-construction-schedule.pdf)
will operate under a construction schedule from March 24-June 1. Four daily
round trips will be suspended, and most trips will be significantly shifted.
# Ferry:  * The Hingham/Hull Ferry will have a new schedule starting March 31.
Weekend service will start May 24. * The East Boston and Lynn ferries will start
weekday service on March 31. Weekend Service will start on April 5 and May 24,
respectively. * The Winthrop and Quincy ferries will be separated into two
separate routes (one is Winthrop-Boston, the other Quincy-Boston). Weekday and
Weekend service will start on April 28 and May 24, respectively.    # TL;DR  *
Weekend service improves on the Blue/Orange Lines.  * Weekday service improves
on the Red/Orange Lines. * Weekday service improves on the 22, 23, 57, 77, 109,
and SL4.  * Sunday service improves on the 1, 32, and 77. * Big changes on Old
Colony CR lines due to SCR opening. * Newburyport/Rockport construction schedule
until June 1    # Sources:  *

In light of all the discussions here lately about fare gates &amp; collection in

event to promote fare payment. I've never seen them &amp; I think it leaves a
bad impression. If I don't see anything being done to enforce fare policy, how
do I know my $ is actually being collected from the fares? I've seen a poster at
South station near the cr platforms, but that's it. This is excluding any mode
that's not cr for reference. I've seen those events on the news before, so I
know they do them. Sometimes.

stopped at 10pm.  I'm signed up for T alerts, but got no notice that they were
stopping them, so I had to take an Uber so I wouldn't be late for work.  Last
time they ran shuttle busses on the North end of the Orange line, Yankee ran
shuttles all weekend.  Time before that, they stopped at 9pm.    No one in MBTA
customer service knows what's going on with Yankee Transport, and I've called
Yankee directly - they don't seem to know either.  I just wanna get to work on
time - anyone know who actually runs the Yankee Transport sh!tshow?

Due to the derailment this morning service was shutdown between Haymarket and

that the shut down was between Copley and Kenmore. Government center is not in
between Copley and Kenmore, how in the world did this pass the sniff test before
announcing it?   This is not the first time issues related to work car
derailments have been improperly announced. The Park St one was announced way
too late for RL passengers as well as the more recent one, but I forget where

Yes, it’s gotten better and no more slow zones, but what’s the point of no slow
zones if it’s constantly “standing by” at every stop?? Defeats the purpose.
Currently standing by at Porter for 10+min and now going to miss my bus and be
very late to a medical appointment.  They continue charging for this sub-par
service and it’s just legalized robbery at this point. They should waive
charging till they get their shit together and stop investing on parking garages
and direct all funds to improving subway infrastructure and get CRRC cars up and
running as quickly as possible.

Title: NIMBY residents express concern about MBTA proposal to build new rail track in Reading, Massachusetts

https://www.wcvb.com/article/reading-mbta-new-rail-track-feb-12-2025/63776178
Some residents are raising concerns after the MBTA announced plans to install a
new commuter rail track on the Haverhill line in Reading, Massachusetts.  The
proposed plan would allow more frequent diesel commuter rail trains to arrive
and leave Reading every 30 minutes, getting riders to North Station in Boston.
The new plan would send the train further down the track to do a turnaround.
However, where it sits, and how long it will sit and idle is all a part of the
issue with nearby residents.  Residents are worried that the new turnback track
that would be a part of the project could impact conservation land.  "Increased
trains is going to increase noise and increase pollution," Reading resident
Allie Hettler said.  "There's going to be idling diesel trains for 15, 30, 45
minutes every hour. from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.," homeowner Joseph Fleury said.
"That's going to have impacts on the children of Reading, the elderly of
Reading, environmental justice communities." (EJ in Reading?)   In a statement,
the T wrote the following regarding the plan: "The MBTA has been making track
improvements along the Haverhill Line to allow for this increased service
frequency. The turnback track in Reading is the final piece of infrastructure
required in order to offer the public more frequent service."  "As someone who
commutes from Reading to Boston, I'm all about improving the service. It's
reliably unreliable, right now. It's always late. The people working the T have
to manually put the signals up and down. It's the same infrastructure forever,
the MBTA has been in debt forever," Hettler said. "How are we pouring more money
into a turnback track on the same infrastructure?"  The Reading town manager
says crossing arms coming down and backing up traffic more frequently is not
good for first responders.  Some passengers are onboard and eager for more
frequent trip options.  "It does hold up traffic you got to be patient and deal
with it," passenger Chris Storti said.  "The improved service will be great for
the community but we want to understand the other costs we are going to
sacrifice," Fleury said.  Reading neighbors are having a gathering to share the
information they know and better understand how the project could affect their
quality of life.  This gathering will be held at the Reading Public Library on
Wednesday at 6 p.m.  The T says it will also host a forum on Feb. 25.

So I've seen this at not only Quincy center but at many other T Stations but do
they not even bother to look into fixing escalators anymore? For crying out loud
the Quincy center escalator has been closed off since late October and there
haven't been actively working on it since like November and it hurts the foot
traffic since you have to either fight your way down the stairs or up the
stairs, now I've gotten used to it because I'm there so often but it's still
rather annoying that they've done nothing to the escalator

I spent the weekend in NYC with my girlfriend, and oh my god. The MTA felt like
a death trap. We took the N, R, 2, and 3 to our destinations around Manhattan
and Long Island City, and we felt like the train was going to derail at any
second and crumple our train car like a tin can. Then we took the Q32 bus to
Grand Central. Those bus drivers drive like there is no tomorrow. We’re going
down these long corridors at what feels like 150 miles an hour on these downtown
streets. The infrastructure was also an absolute mess. Everything is so
slippery. She slipped down the stairs and got subway gunk on her hands at one
point.   I took the commuter rail and bus this morning to work again and never
felt more relaxed on this network. Sure, sometimes things are late and they
break, but appreciate what we’ve got lol.

These are probably the two routes I ride the most. I don't understand why the
longer routes have less frequency than the shorter ones. I don't understand why
I see 2 or 3 39 forest hill buses (one day I saw 4 in a row) before I see one
#10 bus. And the #10 bus is late alot of the time. If the bus is going to be
late most of the time then it should be baked into the schedule somehow. There
really  needs to be 3 buses on that route. Same with the riverside green line.
Why do I see 3 or 4 Boston college or Cleveland circle trains before I see one
riverside train. The riverside goes all the way to Medford Tufts too. They
should give one of the trains to riverside.   And one day I standing at the bus
stop in front of the BMC parking garage and the bus just went right past me. And
then I tried to get on the bus at Copley but it just pulled away even though I
was 5 feet of the bus.  And yesterday I was waiting for the bus and either it
left early or didn't come at all.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m IMMENSELY appreciative of all the work that has been
done as well as the MBTA staff that are really friendly/enthusiastic despite
probably being overworked and underpaid. This post is simply to objectively
point out an issue.   Has anyone else noticed the T being more of a mixed bag
after the recent fixes? Maybe two days of the week I have a relatively smooth
commute. The rest of the days, there’s always “something.”   And I GET IT. I get
that there are more fixes to be done, and removing the slow zones causes other
complications. But the thing is that, the way MBTA described these fixes to the
public felt way too overpromised. It caused people to have conversations like “I
shouldn’t be late to xyz commitment anymore because the T will be much better
after ____ date,” only to realize it wasn’t really the truth. How is that
acceptable? I know that many people have lost jobs and significant income due to
the T. This has an impact on quality of life in Boston way more than most people
realize, but outsiders see it clear as day. And that is just the cold and
unfortunate truth.

Wondering if anyone knows if there is a bike or active transit arm of the MBTA
and who the person in charge of it would be?   I was thinking about some of the
policies that I have encountered lately while taking my bike on the commuter
rail or the Red Line and I'm wondering if it were worth updating those policies
for more nuance.   For example: As a reverse commuter, the trains are often
empty outbound, and it seems counter productive to give MBTA staff a pointless
mandate to chase people with bikes off of them. I completely understand why
bringing a bike on during rush hour when space is limited is not ok, but the
current policy is also not great at stopping this.   For example: If I were to
board at Alewife at 0650 would I be compliant with the policy even though I'd
likely end up at Park or DTX closer to peak travel around 0715 - 0720? If not
compliant, (as I suspect most would agree) there is no real enforcement
mechanism once someone has boarded.   For my part I usually head to South
Station and grab the commuter rail outbound, but if I miss it I head to JFK and
go outbound from there during rush hour. I am asking this group because today an
ambassador yelled at me for going outbound from South Station at 0705 on the Red
Line and realistically the train and platform were empty.  Ultimately I'm
wondering if the MBTA has some sort of Micro-mobility / active transportation
wing to see if there are ways to better improve the synergy there. Additionally,
the draw one bridge project dumped the promised bike/pedestrian link from the
design. It just seems like the MBTA is missing a huge part of the ridership that
utilizes the system in conjunction with a bike/scooter or other device.

I'm on the 12:30-ish Red Line from Braintree and the conductor (is that right?)
is stopping at each station saying it'll be a "slow ride to Alewife due to
signal issues." We crept for the stretch from North Quincy to JFK like the slow
zones had returned. I understand that with faulty signals the trains have to
move slower for safety reasons.  I feel like I've noticed more trains standing
by or moving slow lately, specifically on the Park to Braintree stretch. Just
last night around 6 the Braintree-bound train stood by at North Quincy for what
felt like 10 minutes (but was probably realistically 5) doors open just waiting
to move. Is this a cold weather related issue? Are the signals now failing more
than they were a month ago when the whole Red Line went slow-zone free?  I'm not
blaming anyone or doomerposting, I'm mostly curious if this is an actual thing
actually happening or if it's just bad luck on my end.

For my class Assignment, I have to identify some ways to improve public transit
access to Logan Airport. So I'm curious to know, what are some of the
challenges/inconveniences you face when going to and from the airport? What are
the routes, buses, lines that you take? What do you think would help?   Edit:
For more context, what I've seen on reddit and heard from others is that there
isn't exactly a consensus on the best way to get to and from the airport. Lots
of transfers, limited options for late flights, people turn to expensive
rideshares, which are all things I've experienced as well.   To further more
discussion, possible recommendations include red-blue connector, later or more
frequent bus schedules, a remote terminal, or even extending the blue line to go
directly to the airport.

How is the parking on the Friday after Thanksgiving? I expect it would generally
be open all day, but also with parts of it lost to the forever-stalled repairs,
we have a concern with getting in for an appointment at MGH late in the
morning...any ideas if it's going to be typically weekend levels, or could there
be closer to weekday?  Edit: There was no problem parking there today at
10:00am.

Just some info for those who may be commuting early.  I gave in and had to Uber
to work from Wonderland, but getting the shuttles out has been a disaster as of

If the 238 going outbound is consistently 10-15 min late - why not change the

Why did you shut the red line and when you did not give a better way to get over
the bridge. I’ve been late for work 5 times because of how bad your lines are.
Your commenter lines don’t check tickets and put you on the wrong trains every
single train just shuts down for no reason, and you shut them down with no
explanation, yet still each and every bit of your trains move 5mph. Start over

Hi Everyone,  I am thinking about transportation options for a new job I am
starting in Watertown area. I live close to the Shirley MBTA station and was
thinking about taking the train to Waltham and walking the last 30 minutes or so
to work. I am trying to figure out from a cost standpoint if it makes sense.
The round-trip cost is $5.50 with reduced fare. If I wanted to drive in closer
to say Littleton, Acton, Concord, etc they charge a daily $5 dollar parking fee.
The other caveat is that I must be to work by 9 am. This eliminates every train
but two. To be on time, I would have to take the 7:03 am from Littleton (this
train starts in Littleton with no pickups from Ayer or Shirley) which would
incur an additional $6 dollar charge. If I wanted to take the next available
train from Shirley, I would be late for work by 10 to 30 minutes.  The
alternative is to drive Route 2 to 95 which is looking like an hour to an hour
and a half with heavy traffic.  I am open to suggestions, but it seems like a
lose-lose situation either way.     Thanks!

Even worse, there’s no evening train back to Providence until 7:38 pm! Is there

I'm almost 70, with 2400 reasons every month to continue working full-time.  I
depend on the 120 bus to get me to the Blue Line every day.  That was fine until
this past summer when I noticed that the particular time bus I depend on was
getting later and later almost every day.   Checking the app, I could see that
the bus was entering this route after driving through Chelsea, Charlestown,
North End and the tunnel to get to East Boston.  The alert that they send out
blames traffic while implying that issue comes in Eastie and not in the long
trip to the route.  The app also shows a bus (that would have been mine) leaving
the route, heading back to some bus yard (I'm assuming) in the North Shore.
This is all around 9 am.  Today, the bus was so late that when it finally came
out of the tunnel, it went straight to Orient Heights instead of Maverick.  My
bus was skipped all together and I was 25 minutes late for work.  My assumption
is that the driver who starts the route works part-time and the T doesn't take
into account how long it takes the replacement bus to access the route.  This
has really become a chronic problem.

[Screenshot from Snazzy Maps transit drawn in. Yellow Line is proposed Urban
Ring route, also with Newburyport\/Rockport line re-routed. W = West Station, E
= Encore Arena, T = Tobin
Re-build.](https://preview.redd.it/pobg6utfejud1.png?width=983&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab51dccc3f8be20a22cb6026d5aa5787ed72d8a)
# Introduction  I realize this is completely re-inventing the wheel for Urban
Ring, but with all the Grand Junction discussion lately, I want to share my own
prohibitively expensive idea for how to iteratively implement improved rapid
transit. It also incorporates a few current events that aren’t reflected in the
original plan.  Really, it’s just a massive extension of the Silver Line. As
someone who rides SL3 frequently, I have seen the glory and goodness of **true**
BRT in those short sections. Additionally, my limited transit knowledge leads to
me to believe that BRT could eventually be converted to LRT, so I’m working with
that assumption. As such, my goal is to install piecemeal dedicated ROW in a
manner that would be efficient for riders and digestible for the attached
financing.  # Phase 0  Let’s outline the dedicated ROW we’ve already got:  *
Silver Line Way * Chelsea Busway  And some related items that should supposedly
be done in the near future:  * Sullivan Extension * Airport Covered Walkway  #
Phase 1  Next, add some features to improve the existing ridership experience:
* Boylston Tunnel * D Street Underpass * 90 On/Off-ramps  The Boylston Tunnel
will coalesce the SL1/SL2/SL3 with the SL4/SL5 routes and create create
connections with the Green and Orange lines before resuming its route on
Washington Street. The Seaport improvements will remove the ridiculous off-peak
detour and cut several minutes off legs through the Ted Williams.  With the
motivation for these improvements being a private investment:  * Encore Arena,
new home of the Celtics  Access-wise, I really believe it makes no sense for the
Celtics to leave North Station, but for the purposes of incentivizing ridership
for in my fantasy world, we’ll feed into this rumor. Hell, for the cartoonish
sake of this post, let’s assume Bezos buys the Celtics and pays for everything
in Phase 1 himself. The Silver Line now has a relatively direct route (I-90
traffic aside) from Nubian to Sullivan, and a good collection of attractions
between the Common, Seaport, Encore, and the Airport.  # Phase 2  With newfound
public interest, and this infrastructure falling apart every time I drive on it,
I’m doubling down on the curveball:  * Tobin Bridge Re-build *
Newburyport/Rockport Re-route * Mystic River Busway  With support for rail when
the Tobin is replaced, the Newburyport/Rockport commuter line will run over the
bridge for a more direct link to Chelsea. This will relieve the industrial
trackage and MBTA Mystic River Bridge (Note: I have no idea if these are used
for freight) to replace with a busway. This provides unimpeded access from
Eastie all the way to the Encore Arena, the Gateway Center, Assembly and
Sullivan.  # &lt;North/South Rail Link&gt;  There is an intermission for NSRL as
this needs to happen to relieve the Grand Junction line.  # Phase 3  With NRSL
complete, the Grand Junction railroad will be replaced with yet another LRT
forwards-compatible busway:  * Grand Junction Busway * West Station  This
extends the ring all the way through dense areas in Cambridge to
Allston/Brighton with a connector for the Worcester line. This would require
some linkage to Sullivan in the rail spaghetti by the Boston Engine Terminal.  #
Phase 4  Over time, eliminate the remaining grade crossings throughout the ring.
With this route, my guess of ordering by trip time saved:  * Ted Williams Busway
* Mass Ave + Main St Bypass * Washington Tunnel * Eastie Busway/Bridge  And in
the ultra-long run, items that speak for themselves:  * Complete Ring * Rail
Conversion  # Conclusion  Thanks for reading. As stated, this is basically just
Urban Ring with a Celtics move and a Tobin re-build/re-route, and it’s too
expensive to ever happen, but I like to daydream of a time when all this ROW
will be linked together cohesively for the people.

On my regular Providence line ride home (5:53pm) left Ruggles 15 minutes late,
standing room only. TWO conductors. This line and service needs more frequency
and more staff. I'm worried for people who don't know where to exit. The
business of this train is a positive sign but the service needs to start meeting
the demand in order to continue winning back riders. Even with standing room
only, I'm so much happier to be in the train than on the highway; and I know I'm
not alone. Less waiting and a more predictable schedule on weekends would get a
lot more people riding regularly.

**Source from the Fall River Reporter, directly quoting the MBTA from tonight’s
South Coast Rail meeting in Taunton.**  “Initially, 26 trips were expected to be
part of revenue service daily for the Fall River and New Bedford lines. The team
has since increased total weekday trips between South Station and East Taunton
to 32. This includes 15 trips on the Fall River line (increased from 13) and 17
trips on the New Bedford Line (increased from 13). There will be a total of 26
trips between South Station and East Taunton on the weekends. The project team
expects 70 minutes between trains on weekdays and 120 minutes between trains on
the weekends.   Late night service will be offered to South Coast Rail stations
with the last train leaving Boston just before midnight.   In addition to direct
service, there will also be shuttles operating between each terminus point and
East Taunton Station. This allows for even more frequent service, which is
consistent with the All Day Service model across the rest of the Commuter Rail
network.   The MBTA has determined that the fare structure for all South Coast
Rail stations will be priced in Zone 8. This means that passengers will pay a
full fare of $12.25 and a reduced fare of $6.”  Trains will also run all 7 days
of the week.

 **THE DATA TO PROVE THE MBTA IS IMPROVING**  Trip frequency on the core subway
system has climbed, and in some cases has completely reversed the FTA-era cuts.
Under the fall 2024 schedule that took effect last month, the T now plans to run
198 Blue Line round trips and 165 Orange Line round trips on a typical weekday —
the highest level since 2016, according to TransitMatters data.  Through Aug.
13, before the latest Red Line work began, MBTA officials said they had lifted
more than three-quarters of the speed restrictions that once plagued the system
and shaved a collective 45 minutes off subway travel time as a result.  With
tracks now able to support higher-speed travel, trains are moving faster, albeit
not quite at the same levels they once hit. Over the past 18 months, average
train speeds have increased 33 percent on the Red Line, nearly 25 percent on the
Blue Line and 12.5 percent on the Orange Line, according to a News Service
analysis of TransitMatters data.  **WHAT’s NEXT?”  Eng said he thinks the
biggest hurdle on the horizon for the T is the enormous backlog of work needed
to bring the entire system into a state of good repair. Last year, the agency
put a $24.5 billion price tag on fixing every asset that's currently not in a
state of good repair.  In addition to the track program, Eng said there's a
number of things on his to-repair list: upgrading the subway's signals, getting
new Orange and Red Line cars on the tracks, eventually replacing Green Line
trolleys with new Type 10 cars, modernizing stations, and improving accessible
service.  For everyday riders, [TransitMatters Lab Co-lead] Matté said he hopes
the T will focus next on shortening headways.  "You want to be able to just show
up at the stop and know that it's not going to be that long until your next
train if you miss one. You don't have to plan around a schedule, you're not late
because of the T. You just know you have to get up, get to the T, and know how
long it'll take you to get to your destination," Matté said. "For everyday
riders, it's about dependability."  Unlike the public campaign to eradicate slow
zones by the end of 2024, Eng didn't identify any one specific area among the
$24.5 billion state of good repair backlog as his primary goal for the upcoming
year.  "All of these go hand in hand, and then where are the bigger things that
we need to look at? And there's a lot of desire to see: where do we envision
taking the T in the future?" Eng said, identifying "workforce, safety and
accessibility" as key components of what he sees as the T's roadmap.  As for
future improvements, Johnson said one of the impediments to excellent service
has to do with aging trains on the Red Line, which too frequently break down.
The MBTA has ordered more than 250 new cars and Johnson said the entire order
can’t get here fast enough.  He’d also like to see the T address deficiencies in
bus service.  “Bus trips or slow travel times on the bus are really persistent
issues,” Johnson said. “And those obviously aren’t going to get fixed by
(elimination of) the slow zones or any work on the train.”  He said the focus
next year should be on improving bus operations.  “How do they make sure you’re
not having dropped trips – or what we call ‘bus bunching,’ Johnson said. “That’s
when there’s no bus for a long period of time, then two show up and they’re
overcrowded.”  **THE MBTA’s FUNDING CRISIS AND POTENTIAL END OF PUBLIC TRANSIT
IN BOSTON**  In fiscal year 2026 — which begins in July — T budget-writers
expect to face a roughly $700 million budget shortfall, and they forecast the
gap will grow in subsequent years. Without additional assistance or major cuts,
the MBTA could run out of cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the latest
agency-produced forecast suggests.  Kane [leader of the MBTA Executive Board]
said a solution will need to emerge quickly, especially because the T would need
to notify workers in the spring about hypothetical layoffs — putting at risk
much of the improvement accomplished.  "In 2021, the T put a series of draconian
service cuts on the table," he said. "They expected to net $142 million from
that. This deficit is five times greater than that deficit. There isn't five
times more service to be cut and still call themselves a public transportation
agency. It's an existential crisis."  Warnings about the T's financial outlook
are a perennial feature on Beacon Hill, and some skeptics might view them like a
modern-day boy who cried wolf.  Kane insists that the situation is worse now
because of lingering effects from the pandemic. Ridership — and the fare revenue
it brings with it — still remains stuck well below pre-COVID levels, and
commuters who have come back appear more likely to pay for individual trips
rather than the weekly or monthly passes that steer more money to the T.  Eng
said MBTA officials are talking about potential cost savings, and he suggested
he is not "panicking" about the potential shortfall. He stressed that "we're not
going to be able to find all of those savings on our own," seemingly hinting
that the T might look for an infusion of state aid.  T officials in recent
months have cast heightened attention on the agency's funding history,
delivering lengthy public presentations about the "forward funding" system that
dedicates a portion of the state's sales tax revenue to the agency.  "We saw the
disinvestment in our infrastructure, we saw the disinvestment in our workforce,
and that absolutely was the wrong direction. That's why we want to make sure
that we continue to talk about how we got to where we were just a year and a
half ago, and where we've come from from that point," Eng said.  He continued,
"That is just to show, starkly, that we don't want to go back there. Nobody
wants us to go back there."  **WHAT DOES TRANSITMATTERS THINK ABOUT THE
FINANCIAL CLIFF?**  (VIA BOSTON 25)   The T’s current funding plan is flawed,
[TransitMatters Executive Director] Johnson said. “A significant portion of the
T’s funding comes from sales taxes. The sales tax (revenue) was expected to grow
5 to 7% year over year and that growth has been closer to 1 or 2 or 3 percent.”
Johnson said that, over the last 15 years, the T has missed out on between $10
and 15 billion.  “What was misunderstood at that time was the impact online
sales were going to have,” he said.  At first, like many states, Massachusetts
did not collect sales tax on online purchases – but eventually did.  Johnson
said the other issue is that the service sector in the Boston area has seen high
growth – and that sector is not a source of sales tax revenue. He hopes the
legislature will come up with a new and stable funding source going forward.

In detailing plans for the state’s transportation infrastructure, she also
highlighted progress on the East-West Rail project, a long-awaited passenger
rail service connecting Boston to Pittsfield and Albany, New York.  “Once you
get outside of the inner core, there aren’t a lot of rail options. And we’re
continuing to move forward with that project,” Tibbits-Nutt said.  The $108
million part of the project to connect Boston to Springfield is scheduled for
completion in 2028, she said.  She also praised the recent launch of the MBTA
Income-Eligible Reduced Fare Program. Tibbits-Nutt credited Gov. Maura Healey’s
administration and the Legislature for their role in securing funding for this
initiative.  “This has been something that we’ve been pushing for, and the
amount of difference this is going to make — for millions of riders — is
amazing,” she said.  Tibbits-Nutt briefly discussed the challenges of
implementing late-night T service and a North-South Rail Link, saying there’s
more research needed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing both projects.
“North-South Rail, this is a project that’s been talked about for 20-plus
years,” Tibbits-Nutt said. “What we’re doing now is really putting together what
it would take for MassDOT to do a feasibility test of that project.”

Title: MBTA News | MBTA and GM Eng to consider adding late-night subway service (via GBH)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bar-hoppers, concert-goers and late-night workers who struggle to commute to and
from jobs — MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng says he wants to help you.  While
other major cities like New York and Chicago offer 24/7 subway service, the T’s
trains usually don’t operate from about 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. But during an
appearance on Boston Public Radio Monday, Eng said he’s considering running some
trains later to help people who need more transit options after midnight.  “I’ve
been talking with my operations folks regarding the potential for later night
service,” Eng said.  His comments came in response to a caller who complained
about being stranded after a concert at Gillette Stadium this summer. The caller
said she was able to take a special service commuter line train from Foxborough
that arrived at Back Bay at around 1 a.m. But she missed her connecting Orange
Line train to Malden — which was the final one of the night — so she had to pay
$38 for an Uber.  Boston’s subway system used to offer 24-hour service until the
MBTA took it over in the 1960s. Most recently in 2014, the T ran a late-night
train, but the pilot ended after two years because the agency said ridership
wasn’t high enough to justify the operational expenses.  Eng acknowledged the
cost concerns Monday, but suggested more late-night options may still be
worthwhile.  “How do we make sure that people that want to use our system for
these events can use it in both directions and get to home and to the event
safely and reliably,” he said. “For our essential workers, too. I know so many
people that need our system start [work] earlier than our system starts, or
[work] later.”  The possibility of late-night service comes as Eng remains
confident that overall ridership on the subway will increase.  Rider numbers
across all T services have been hovering at around 65% of pre-pandemic levels.
That’s even though the commuter rail has seen ridership rebound better than
similar train lines nationwide, Eng said.  Going forward, he said the subway
will become a more attractive transit option as the T improves reliability. He
said the agency is on pace to eliminate all slow zones by the end of the year.
New Orange Line and Red Line cars also are being delivered after years of
delays, and the T plans on upgrading Green Line trains as well.  “Safe,
reliable, frequent service brings people back,” Eng said. “We’re already seeing
that the frequency of our subway lines are increasing. On all of our Red,
Orange, Blue, Green [lines], we’re running more trains.”

I would have to say Bowdoin. The station doesn’t experience much crime, it’s
just always mostly empty and eerie as hell. The station is practically unchanged
from the late 1960s, feels very liminal and stuck in a bygone era of Boston. The
SB platform of Chinatown also has an inexplicable creepiness to it. Until about
a year ago when they upgraded the lighting at Community College, that station
was spooky as hell at night too. Soo dark and deserted that it felt abandoned

So after a day around the city and North End, I took the Green Line from North
Station to Riverside, heading towards Fenway—my usual work commute.  Lately,
I’ve noticed that they sometimes park the train on the Boston College side at
Kenmore, and once, they even changed the destination from Riverside to Boston
College. But tonight was something else entirely.  Around 9:30 pm, I was in the
second car, right behind the driver. We went through Kenmore, and as soon as we
came above ground, most of us were ready to get off at Fenway.  But when I
looked outside, I was shocked—it wasn’t Fenway. We were on Commonwealth Ave, in
the BU area—the first stop on the BU line! Confused, I got off, thinking I
missed a destination change, even though I remember checking at Kenmore.  I
asked the driver of the second cab, "Wasn't this train supposed to go to
Riverside?" He replied, "It still is."  I gave him a confused look, and at the
same momy I his co-driver from the first cab called and told him, "We fucked up,
took the wrong path and ended up on the BU line." I went crazy laughing   It was
another new experience on the green line, they ended up emptying the train and
asked us to just get a reverse direction train to Kenmore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**TRACK IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM SCHEDULE**  * The MBTA has announced that the Orange
Line will be slow-zone free by October, the Red Line by December, and the Green
Line by November. In October, the Orange Line shutdown will be split in two,
with early October being scheduled for a shutdown between Back Bay and Forest
Hills and late October being scheduled between North Station and Oak Grove.  *
In November, the Green Line will be shutdown between Park Street, Medford/Tufts,
and Union Square to fix slowzones between Government Center and North Station.
* In December, the Red Line will have two shutdowns, first working on the
Kendall/MIT-Central southbound slowzone (with a Harvard-Park shutdown), then
finishing up with removal of slowzones near JFK/UMass.  **RIVERSIDE
REDEVELOPMENT**  * The MBTA is planning to redevelop the Riverside parking lot
with 540 housing units (with 20-25% of them being affordable housing), over 650
parking spaces, and life-sciences buildings, with it being done in two phases.
* The project is due to be complete in 2034.  **FUNDING CRISIS CONVERSATION**  *
The MBTA is now talking about how the state’s forward funding method to support
the MBTA has failed to keep up with inflation and how it needs more support to
avoid a potential catastrophic closure of the MBTA system.   * GM Eng has been
talking to the US government to ask for operating funding from groups such as
the FTA.  * Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, has begun
lobbying at the State House for the state to provide more operating funds and
will begin reaching out in the fall.   * u/oh-my-chard has evaluated this
specific issue in a post made earlier today. This post will be linked in the
pinned comment below. I will also link to a CommonwealthBeacon article that
simplifies this issue into a nice article and how the state has not responded to
this crisis.   **NEW “THE RIDE” APP**  * The MBTA will be launching a brand new
app for The Ride, called “Ride Along”.  * This app will allow The Ride
passengers to know their driver is in real time. The app is currently in beta
and will be released to the public in October of this year.  **INCOME-ELIGIBLE
REDUCED FARE PROGRAM BEGINS SEPT. 4TH**  * The MBTA is launching the
Income-Eligible Reduced Fare program on September 4th.  * For all information
about this, a post about it from me will be linked in the comments below. One of
the pinned posts currently from u/streetsblogmass also has more information.
**SAFETY PROGRAM UPDATE**  * The MBTA is set to release their Transit Safety
Plan to the Federal Transit Administration, or FTA, on Sept. 1st with revisions
and data made to ensure safety for passengers and workers.  **FTA INSPECTION
UPDATE**  * The MBTA has responded to the FTA’s SD-22-12 CAP 6 request as a part
of their 2022 investigation into the MBTA, which requires an evaluation of
creating a mentorship program for rail operators.   * The MBTA will be launching
the new rail operator mentorship in the winter of 2025.   **GM ENG’s UPDATE TO
THE BOARD**  * Eng has stated that the new fall schedule will increase Red Line
service by 11 percent and decrease wait time/headways by 11 percent, increase
Orange Line service by 17 percent and decrease headways by 18 percent, and
increase Blue Line service and decrease headways by 10 percent.   * The MBTA has
updated 50% of the Orange Line’s and 57% of the Red Line’s signal system from
analog to digital.  ALL DOCUMENTS WILL BE LINKED IN THE PINNED COMMENT BELOW.

Title: TransitMatters declares Alewife-Kendall July shutdown a success, with 5 minutes of slowzones removed. Here is why.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLDR version, with most important data pulled.   **PRE-SHUTDOWN DATA**  In
January 2021 (the last month that the Red Line had no slow zones), the average
travel time northbound between Alewife and Kendall/MIT was 14 minutes and 14
seconds and 12 minutes and 58 seconds southbound.  By July 2024, the average
travel time northbound between Alewife and Kendall/MIT was 17 minutes and 27
seconds and 15 minutes and 5 seconds southbound.  **POST-SHUTDOWN DATA**  In the
weeks following the shutdown, the average travel time northbound between Alewife
and Kendall/MIT was 13 minutes and 39 seconds and 13 minutes and 48 seconds
southbound - a savings of 4.8 minutes of travel time between Alewife and
Kendall/MIT.  Compared to early July, there are 3.6-minute savings northbound
and 77-second savings northbound, bringing travel times back in line with
pre-COVID averages.  Late last year, The Harvard Crimson published an op-ed
describing a student's 38-minute commute from Alewife to Park Street. Luckily
for this student, since the publication of this article, the average commute
between those two stops has dropped by nearly 12 minutes, a 40% decrease.  The
T’s extension of the shutdown to Park Street and JFK/UMass on weekends didn’t
produce travel time savings for riders, but it did allow the T to remove five
miles of scrap rail from the right of way as it had intended.

Title: Which station will and which should be renovated next on each line?

Post ID: 1ewch8n

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the title says - which station should (very flexible budget) and which will
be renovated, on each line?  I'll go first: Blue line: Should: Bowdoin - just
because even with low ridership, and it's inevitable shutdown come Red-blue
connection, it really need an accessibility upgrade. There are enough
impaired-mobility riders who will use Bowdoin day-to-day who can't actually make
a .25 mile walk from GC. And this is just the fix for the elevator. I believe a
news outlet did a video on it recently and it's in disgraceful shape. The
station interior could use a slight cleaning too. The station is rough.  Will be
renovated: I imagine Suffolk Downs in preparation for the development there will
be enhanced before Bowdoin gets any fixes, unfortunately. The station actually
has accessibility and structural issues itself too anyway.   Red Line: Should:
Park Street, actually. It's an extremely busy hub that gets a ton of tourist
visibility, gets very packed, has limited amenities or anything technological,
and wayfinding shouldn't be archaic as it is. And escalators break too much
here.  Will: I think Alewife is actively in the process?  Orange: Should (budget
very open): State. Get a moving walkway between the two platforms, modernize the
platforms, decor is dated, and make it fit in with the glitz of nearby Financial
District.  Will: I'd imagine Back Bay will be updated in the coming years as the
station gets renovated along with the planned larger developments around it
planned.  Green: Should: Don't crucify me on this  one - but I don't think this
station was built up to its full potential and they cut a lot of costs to save
on it. It could very well be a very busy terminal since this area should only be
a very busy area for new jobs at Boynton Yards. More shelter, another entrance
or exit, and more lighting would actually help.  Will: Haymarket I think will
get renovations as part of the larger Bulfinch Crossing development.  Commuter
Rail: Should: Lowell. It's decrepit. Not much more to say than that and that you
should look up pictures. We're probably not getting a NH rail extension, but
it's still bad.  Will: This is hard to guess since a lot of stations have been
updated lately I feel, or they're in-process. I'd say Porter because it's a
pretty high ridership stop and there's really poor accessibility and wayfinding
to the platforms. Not a huge fan.

Something I caught in the MBTA Board Meeting I haven't seen others talking
about. There's now a timeline for increasing Braintree branch speeds to 50 mph.
Sounds like we should expect it in late November/early December. The additional
2 months after 40 mph service is restored is to give time for operator training,
testing, etc to accommodate higher speeds.  Source:

When it's really crowded at North station its hard to get the attention of

I’m taking a vacation to MVY starting tomorrow and I’m considering taking the
Cape Flyer to get to Woods Hole. It seems pretty straightforward on the website:
take the train from South Station, alert the conductor if you are taking a
steamship authority ferry, get off at Bourne and take the shuttle to woods hole
to catch the 10:45 ferry. I had a few more questions though:  Is it reliable? Is
it often late or behind schedule?  We want to bring 3 duffels and a backpack, is
this acceptable?  How is the shuttle? Does it consistently meet the train?
I’ve heard that Bourne to Hyannis is the slow part of the trip, so getting off
at Bourne is the play. Is that true?  Thanks in advance.

Title: Commuter Rail Boiling Hot

I love that they check tickets on the commuter rail more often now. It’s boiling
hot and the trains are always late in the afternoon. It’s definitely worth my
$12.50 to ride for at least an hour in a train so hot my phone is going to
overheat. Amtrak is always late and we always have to accommodate them. I don’t
get why they don’t have the AC working when this is probably the sixth hot day
of this summer so far. Almost makes me want to just drive to work. Almost.
Sorry, I needed to vent because I feel like I’m being burned.

Might be a dumb question but when they say trains are delayed due to “equipment
shortages” is that just code for “hey the reverse train was late so now this one
is too “ or is it more complicated than that. Seeing a lot of these on the

1.) A survey done by MassINC present an overall view of the MBTA over the last 2
decades, showing that more people are starting to think the MBTA is improving
among the Commuter Rail and buses, but not the trolley or subway, have different
views of how to finance the system, and more. These statistics are shown above
in the slideshow.  2.) Someone in the public talks about how the MBTA needs to
improve the rolling stock of the Commuter Rail.  3.) Another person in the
public talks about the financial cliff the MBTA is currently facing for next
year budget.  4.) GM Eng then talks about the past shutdown on the Orange Line
and the upcoming one starting on Saturday as a part of the Track Improvement
Program.  5.) There will be no more Red Line shutdowns as a result of the
Dorchester Avenue bridge that leads in and out of the Andrew-JFK/UMass and will
reopen in September.   6. ) Eng then talks about the South Coast Rail  and what
is causing the delay of service (they are running test trains until January and
then needs final verification to run trains by the federal government to make
sure the infrastructure works). They will see how to accelerate work to open
service earlier.  7.) Eng next talks about the work force (about 7,600 workers
in the MBTA system as of right now) and labor unions (all labor unions are now
in agreement with the MBTA).

8.) We then hear about third-party bus contacts (as a result of the Track
Improvement Program). The MBTA is meeting with different cities in the Boston
region in order to best coordinate how to address the needs of each shutdown.
The MBTA may soon use their own operators to run shuttle buses on the weekdays
due to the growth of the workforce.

9.) Yankee is winning about 90% of shuttle buses contracts due to having the
resources to run these shuttles and having low-floor buses, as well as
responding in a timely manner.   10.) The MBTA is going to reopen existing
contacts with all vendors.  11.) A safety report is shown to the board.

12. ) MassDOT and the MBTA is working on a plan to improve the MBTA over the
next 25 years and will be released late next year.

1. ) GM Eng first changed the SCR management team when reviewing the status .
The new manager, Karen Antion, stated that the construction of all stations are
nearly done EXPECT for East Taunton, which is about 75% done and will be
completed in August. Antion blamed “material delays" and “challenges getting the
elevators to work properly” for East Taunton’s lagging construction. She said a
site visit Thursday showed these issues were being taken care of.   2.) Test
trains will begin on Monday alongside the entire new track starting Monday to
simulate regular passenger service the track have been verified safe to ride on
and now signal testing will the main thing being focused on.   3.) The SCR will
be falling under the Zone 8 fare. This zone is is $12.25 each way. A reduced
fare of $6 is available for people 65 or older, students, and the disabled.
4.) The trip will take 90 minutes in total. There is still no information on
what the train schedule will look like or if there will be weekend service.  5.)
Some are questioning the MBTA for pushing the launch of the SCR even further
than the original dates of late 2023 and early 2024. Ken Fiola, executive vice
president of the Bristol County Economic Development Consultants, told Eng
during a public comment session that “I think if nothing else the MBTA owes this
region and this city and the residents of this city an apology — an apology for
misleading the entire region with false promises and deadlines.”   6.)
Furthermore, this meeting was announced only yesterday, which brings the issue
of transparency into play once again since many people could not attend the
meeting. Official notes one reason for this is because of the shift in the SCR
management team and trying to catch them up to date on the project.

Title: Ridiculous MBTA Customer Service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can see that MBTA doesn't train their staff properly and makes it difficult
for clients who paid for the service to ride their transit.  I paid for a
monthly $90 Perq Charlie card last month (May 10th), and it should have arrived
before June 1st to use for this month. But it got sent out late, and I've been
waiting for it since without any success. When I called my employer benefits dep
and MBTA last week to let them know that my card didn't arrive, they immediately
sent out a replacement card and later announced by email that a replacement card
fee of $5 will be charged. I didn't ask for a replacement card and definitely
not for a fee. They are charging me $95, but I haven't gotten anything. This is
the definition of poor service.  Today, when I was trying to ride the train, the
staff stopped me and asked me to step down because I only have the receipt and
not the card. Even after explaining my situation, she said since the card is not
physically here, I still need to pay for each ride. This is so RIDICULOUS that
I'll repeat: MBTA staff is saying that I cannot ride the bus or subway without a
card or ticket, so I need to step out of the subway train and pay for a new
Charlie card or walk up to Park Plaza Charlie Card store to get another Charlie
card. She didn't get the difference between regular Charlie card and a Perq
employer benefit Charlie card. I cannot get a random Charlie card at the store
because the Perq Charlie card is handled by another department... She was so not
getting it and SO UNHELPFUL and SO RUDE!  This should be addressed properly so
that MBTA staff doesn't ask clients who rightfully paid for the monthly rides to
pay extra out-of-pocket for what MBTA and mail service did wrong. Is MBTA trying
to punish clients for purchasing their service? If so, we should sue them.

This extension will help support Bus Route 77 (Arlington Htgs-Harvard) by
installing the extension of the shared bus/bike lane. This begins today, May
20th, with completion anticipated in the next few days (weather depending). The
project includes the addition of an outbound lane from Alewife Brook Parkway to
the opposite side of Lafayette Street.  **CITED FROM MBTA**  The expanded shared
bus/bike lane will benefit approximately 5,000 daily bus riders using Route 77,
based on Fall 2023 ridership. This segment of Massachusetts Avenue will also
provide a link to existing inbound bus lanes in Arlington and Cambridge on
either side of the new segment, which will span from Boulevard Road to Alewife
Brook Parkway, facilitating smoother bus travel and enhancing the convenience of
traveling from Arlington to Harvard Square. A study by the City of Cambridge
found that buses traveling on Massachusetts Avenue were 31-40% faster on average
after the installation of this bus lane in late 2021 between Dudley Street and
Alewife Brook Parkway.    In conjunction with the expansion of the shared
bus/bike lanes, the installation of a Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon (RRFB)
at the Lafayette Street crosswalk is expected to yield safety enhancements,
improving overall mobility and circulation for residents, employees, and
visitors.

I have a 9-day trip out of Logan coming up this summer and I saw that the blue
line will be free and parking will be $2/day at Wonderland during the Sumner
Tunnel closure (my trip is late July, during the closure). I don't typically fly
out of Logan, I'm in Maine so I usually go from either Manchester or Portland,
so this is uncharted territory for me.  I honestly tried researching these
answers on the MBTA site, here on Reddit, and in other places, and the things I
found were not exactly clear.  1) Is it even okay for me to park for 9 days
straight at Wonderland? It looks like I'd have to use the PayByPhone app
multiple times to stay there for that length, correct?  2) My flight is in the
9:00am hour, so I was planning to get to Wonderland about 7:00 or so. How full
is the garage likely to be at that time on a Monday? (I do realize the blue line
car might be pretty full going from Wonderland to Airport)  3) Am I remembering
correctly that the same things happened last year (free blue line, $2/day
parking)? Did/Will the $2/day parking apply to multi-overnight stays?  Thanks in
advance for any help with this!

A brief list of schedule oddities:  * They've really ramped up the late night
outbound "Get on this other line then change at X to the one you want" trains.
Newburyport, Kingston, and Needham all have this now. * Kingston has the
privilege of the last inbound train doing that but with the RL at Braintree (I
have no idea how to map this.) * The weird Lynn/Swampscott morning outbound
express is gone * ...and has been replaced by a new weird
two-thirds-of-Wellesley/Natick Sq morning outbound express * A bunch of inbound
(And only inbound?) Haverhill trains going via Wildcat and stopping at
Anderson/Woburn * A single Franklin Line train that runs non-stop over the
Fairmount Line * Some Fairmount Line trains short-turning at Fairmoun * The
first inbound Haverhill Line train starts at Lawrence, not Haverhill * Forest
Hills/Hyde Park stopping pattern is as bananas as ever  Formatting mistakes:  *
Franklin Train #757 says "VIA FAIRMOUNT LINEE" lol * Franklin/Foxboro also has
the "Bikes Allowed" text in the wrong font * Worcester Train #541 has its
departure time from Ashland in bold     Not new but the symbol for the high

at Market and Vineland streets (in the Boston Landing area).  “Riders want to
know: Can we trust the T?  Trains and buses run late or never show. A crumbling
infrastructure has led to equipment failures that threaten riders' safety. Many
riders have simply given up and joined the snarl of car traffic. After one year

But is he on track?  GBH News Transportation reporter Bob Seay welcomes MBTA

Hi all. I’m visiting the city for the first time later this week for college
related things. I’ll be moving to Boston this summer for work. That said, I’m
unfamiliar with the T, so any insight would be much appreciated. I’d like to get
familiar with the system when I visit so that I’ll be better at navigating upon
my move.  I’m from the rural south USA, so public transport is something I’m
historically very unfamiliar with. I recently visited DC and have visited Buenos
Aires and NYC, whose public train/subways vary greatly in safety. The DC metro
was also very user-friendly as well as unusually clean and orderly.  For my
Boston trip, I’ll be flying in and staying in the Seaport area, and would like
to take the silver line from the airport to get close to where I’m staying.
Would it be unusual to have my suitcase on the train? Could that be a safety
concern? Ubers are just so expensive lately, so I’d rather not go that route if
possible.  Also apologies if this is a seemingly silly question. City living is
not my expertise.

I don’t know what, if anything, I should have done.  The green line was
thoroughly fucked up this evening. I finally got on a B outbound at Harvard Ave
at 7:30 after waiting about half an hour. Because it was the first train for
that long and there were two more trains visible behind it, it declared it was
going express from Griggs St to BC. The announcement came before the train
actually got to Griggs and a guy standing near me got so upset that it wasn’t
stopping at Washington St that he pulled the emergency brake and fell straight
into my leg when the brake worked.  It hurt at the time, but not enough to make
everyone else’s night even worse by telling the driver and holding up the train
some more.  An hour later and I’m sitting here with ice on my swelling knee and
wondering if I should have told the driver anyway, but it’s too late now.

I've been a low-key transit nerd most of my life; I remember being a kid and
asking for my own street map atlases (remember those old Arrow brand ones) after
seeing my Dad's, and getting them, and drawing railroad extensions all over
their pages. Been seeing a lot of futureMBTA maps lately and what-could-bes and
what-could-have-beens, been following the space since the days of
vanshookenraggen at least. Have a lot of thoughts on the matter; Thought I'd
toss my hat in the ring for some extension ideas. Here's a first for an RLX
branch off Harvard... maybe there'll be more.  **RED LINE**  This is the line
I've thought about the most. Southwards it's pretty set; One could argue the
Mattapan Trolley should be converted to heavy rail and fully integrated into the
rest of the line, but I'm mainly focused on completely new lines here. I've long
thought a branch coming off Harvard would bring lots of benefit, and I've put a
lot of thought over some years into what it could look like. Here's what I think
would be the best for it to look like.  --  *Harvard Extension Branch*  *
Riverbend Station: Northwards (well, westwards, really), starting from Harvard,
this line would run under Mt Auburn Street with a stop at Riverbend, just past
Longfellow Park. This could both serve the Mt. Auburn Hospital as well as
Longfellow Park and by extension the LDS Church, as well as the Riverview
Condominiums and other dense housing in the area. As you'll read below, the LDS
Church, with all its focus on genealogy and respect of our ancestors and
deceased relatives, would probably also benefit from a direct connection to
*four* cemeteries (at least! -- four by my count, anyways) -- Mt. Auburn
Cemetery and Cambridge Cemetery (which of course it already has via the 71 &amp;
73), but then Calvary and Mt. Feake as well.  --  * Mugar Square Station:
Continuing onwards to the intersection with the Watertown-Cambridge Greenway (on
the old Watertown Loop RoW), there'd be a second station around there. Off
admittedly only a little preliminary research, the Mugar family are prominent
philanthropists in the Boston area who've seemingly supported lots of quality
causes over the decades, and their fortune originates in Star Market. Not only
that, but some of its members are buried in Mt. Auburn Cemetery, and they were
longtime residents of Belmont and Watertown. It's just an idea, but it could
make a lot of sense, maybe, to name this intersection/area in their honor --
It's where the Mt. Auburn Cemetery is, as well as a Star Market. An alternate
name here would obviously be "Mt. Auburn," though my hesitation to just go for
that out the gate is the confusion it could create with Riverbend Station, which
would be the ideal stop for the Mt. Auburn Hospital. In any case, the Mugar
Square station would service the Mt. Auburn Cemetery of course, as well as
encourage further development of the space the old Star Market currently
occupies. I have nothing against a supermarket there, but it's flat and wide
with an enormous parking lot; Much could be done with that space in this day and
age, and possibly even the space between the Star Market all the way to Aberdeen
Ave. There's a big mix of old and new there that could all be redeveloped into
much more efficient use of the acreage, perhaps even built around the new
station or with it in mind. And hell, maybe naming it after the Mugars secures
some funding; Lord knows the T needs it.  --  * Arsenal Station: From Mugar
Square, the line would run under the Watertown-Cambridge Greenway to the Arsenal
and Watertown Malls. With the Arsenal recently redeveloped and becoming far more
of a community center, I'd redevelop the Watertown Mall (which is also already
being discussed anyways) next, to again more efficiently make use of that space,
building the station around it. Naturally, this station would service the malls
and the Arsenal as a whole.  --  * Watertown Square Station: From Arsenal I'd
cut-and-cover under Arsenal Street to Watertown Square. Again, like the Arsenal,
this is pretty self-explanatory. It would also offer an alternate route to the
71 to get from Harvard to Watertown Square or vice versa, lightening the load on
one of the T's higher-traffic bus routes (not that the 71 compares to the 1 or
anything, but... it's up there), possibly without fully making it obsolete. It
leaves room for the 71 route to continue existing, in any case.  --  * Russo
Station: Alternatively known as the "Jesus Fucking Christ Watertown, Get Your
Goddamn Shit Together and Do Whatever You Need to do to Save Russo's" Station,
this would be named after the century-long staple fresh market everyone in
Greater Boston knows and loves, ideally with a return of said market (I'm still
not over it and neither is anyone I know!). In terms of where exactly it would
be situated, I'm not 100% sure, but the idea would be to optimally serve, yes,
Russo's of course (hopefully guaranteeing a big and bright future for it for
centuries to come), but furthermore everything noteworthy in the vicinity --
From Calvary Cemetery, to the new Watertown Mews, to Gore Place and Walker Pond,
to the River City Plaza, and to all the smaller local businesses around. The
route from Watertown Square could follow either Pleasant/River Street
cut-and-cover or the old Watertown Loop RoW, either way achieves the same effect
so it just depends which is cheaper and more feasible.  --  * Waltham Station:
Here, the extension would intersect with the Wachusett Line of course, serving
Waltham's commuters as well as Moody Street's nightlife. A singular rapid
transit heavy rail connection from Moody Street, to Russo's and the surrounding
area, to the Arsenal, to Harvard Square, I cannot help but imagine holds immense
potential for locals. An infill station could be explored at the old Chemistry
Station site, possibly to serve the high-density lower-income suburban housing
area south of the river and east of Moody Street, but it would feel pretty close
to Waltham Station itself.  --  * Brandeis/Roberts Station: The new terminus!
There's space just past the station, by the river, for a turnaround loop, and
the possibility of closing Brandeis/Roberts on the Wachusett Line could be
explored to cut time on trips from Wachusett to Boston and vice versa. Riders
would then naturally transfer at Waltham Center Station, and again, I can't help
but think that in general a single rapid transit heavy rail connection from
Brandeis University to Russo's and the surrounding area, Watertown Square, the
Arsenal, Mt. Auburn Hospital, and Harvard has near-infinite potential. Both Mt.
Auburn Hospital and Mass General Hospital could better partner with Brandeis
University for medical and social work internships and the like, while Moody
Street and possibly a further developed Arsenal as well as the direct connection
to Harvard Square could offer massive nightlife opportunities for students if
they're well-capitalized on. Taking it one step further, this would put UMass
Boston, MIT, Harvard University, and Brandeis University all on one single rapid
transit corridor, better connecting Brandeis University to Greater Boston's
overall higher-education "world". Hell, with some creative civil engineering
(lol) Bentley could splurge for a spur between Russo Station and Waltham Station
coming through somewhere across Linden Street, Access Road, and Beaver Brook,
though that's a whole additional enormous stretch and a simple shuttle to
Waltham and/or Russo Station would probably suffice. Riverbend, Mugar Square,
and Watertown Square Stations all also offer connections to more suburban areas
which could house students easily granting them a quick ride to class from home,
and with Russo's on the system and how fresh and health-conscious it was, both
students and the hospitals could see a massive boon as well.  Obviously, I know,
I know, this'll never happen in a billion years because building transit in the
USA and especially in Boston is borderline impossible these days. But if our
systems and transit infrastructure were much smoother, akin to some in Europe or
in Japan... Maybe something like this could be something we'd get. A guy can
dream! Tell me this wouldn't be kind of a dream come true, though, with how many
major population centers and hotspots a branch like this would connect and
service.

Schedule help  Hello all 🫡   My husband and I have tickets to a show at the
Wilbur in late April.   We live in NH, and are still fairly new to using the T.
We’ve probably taken about 5 or 6 day trips to Boston in the last year where we
relied on the T to get around. We pretty much get the gist of it all at this
point, but are still fairly novice.   We want to take the train (Newburyport to
North Station on Commuter, North Station to Tufts Medical Center on OL, reverse
to get home) to get to/from the show. The problem is that there are no train
schedules available yet for that date.   When should we expect the Spring/Summer
schedule to be released? Is it vastly different from the winter schedule? Any
advice as to how to plan out this trip? Thanks in advance!   ( if the mods see
that I posted, deleted, and reposted this like 3 times, please forgive me, I
kept screwing up and couldn’t figure out how to edit the post 😭)

Hey all,  In the last week or so the MBTA fare terminals have been rejecting my
card when I use Samsung Pay. I've had absolutely zero issues with this since
they rolled out these terminals. I thought it might just be an issue with
Samsung Pay, so I switched to Google Pay and everything went back to normal for
a few days. Well, lo and behold the terminals have now started rejecting my card
using Google Pay. I successfully used it earlier today, and then when I tried to
use it again to catch my train home from Back Bay it was rejected at every
single terminal. Another guy was in the same boat, I had to get an MBTA employee
to let me through and we both missed the train.  Is this a known issue? It only
started in the last week and half or so for me but it is consistent. No other
vendors reject my card when I use my phone to pay, it's only the MBTA.

So ive come into an issue recently.  once a month maybe twice ive taken the
commuter rail my being route (worcester/Framingham line &lt; Backbay &lt; subway
to north station &lt; Newbury/Rockport line &lt; bus)  Previously this wasent an
issue, since I used the highscool reduced fare and reduced round trips plus
subways and bus costed me 33 dollars total. However now that im out of
highschool and in college i cant use the reduced fare anymore and the trip is
costing me 53 dollars total. If I went twice a week what was already a steep 66
dollars for me is now 106    I stay for about 4 days from friday to Monday so I
cant use weekend passes. I go through too many zones for 5 day flex pass. And i
really cant find any alternative than maybe leaving a day earlier to get 6
dollars off. Is there any possible way I could make this trip cheaper?

I guess there's a new batch. I signed up to be an original beta tester of the
new fare system,  but; seniors and other reduced fare were excluded from the
tests until now, I guess.  As a senior, I still have to use the old fare system
and an MBTA-issued plastic wallet card with an embedded chip; I refill my mbta
senior account at fare machines.  In filling out the form, above, I said I'm
available to try the smartphone option, as well as whatever the unspecified

Title: I recreated the whole MBTA system in Subway Builder - Accurate to the real trackage and service times.

This was mainly created using the [MBTA
TrackMap](https://www.vanshnookenraggen.com/_index/docs/Boston_MBTA_TrackMap.pdf)
and Google Maps. Subway Builder is still in beta, so there were some limitations
in how I could recreate the real system and still have it work. This should be
thought of as being accurate to the Right-of-Ways used by the MBTA, and roughly
accurate to how the physical tracks are laid out. The order from deepest to
shallowest should always be correct for stacked tunnels at least. I used the
posted service frequencies from the [MBTA's
website](https://www.mbta.com/schedules) to assign number of cars per line, but
had to reduce D and E trains due to overcrowding.  Yards recreated:  *
Southhampton &amp; Cabot yards * Inner Belt carhouse &amp; Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility * The Grand Junction &amp; Beacon yard * Orient Heights
yard * Bowdoin yard * Readville yard * Reservoir carhouse * Wellington carhouse
Disused tunnels:  * Tracks under Tremont St to the former Pleasant St portal *
Tracks between current Green Line tracks that led to the former Boylston St
portal * Former tracks under the abandoned Haymarket Sq Green Line platform *
Tracks south of Harvard to the former Eliot yard portal  Notable issues:  * The
Red Line incline between Park St and Charles/MGH want able to fit in-game, so I
had to snake it around. * The Green Line incline between North Station and
Science Park is the same situation, just more extreme. * In-game routing is not
happy with the Green Line's 100+ year old trackage, and does some double-backs
along the route (Notably the B branch to Reservoir). Also occurs with the Silver
Line. * The game doesn't have curved stations, causing issues in various places.
* All Commuter Rail lines terminate at the edge of the calculated in-game area.
The Needham and Fairmount lines both terminate within the map boundaries. * The
Silver line was created as Light Metro since there are no busses in game  The
game save file can be downloaded as a .json, I have it posted in the Subway
Builder Discord if you want to run it for yourself, in the save-files forum
titled "Boston with Accurate Trackage"

Brian Shortsleeve was back in the news with an appearance on channel 5s otr. No
surprises here, but his policies make no sense &amp; have no shot of being
popular in MA. Here’s what he said about the t &amp; its issues the last few
years. I didn’t transcribe everything, but he really wanted to make it clear he
was proud of what he did in his time at the t. He really goes out of the way to
make that clear.  “I delivered something for the tax payers that Phil Eng &amp;
Maura Healey never had, which is a balanced budget for the mbta. When I got to
the t, we had a 300 million dollar deficit. We were buried in a 100 inches of
snow back in 2015. We got costs under control, we stripped out abuse of overtime
&amp; absenteeism &amp; we delivered a balanced budget. My recommendation to the
governor would be get focused on the mbta’s financial picture because they’re
back on track for a 500 million dollar deficit which tax payers really shouldn’t
be on the hook for.”   Ed Harding steps in to mention the numerous derailments
&amp; fires in the system &amp; presses on how  it make sense to say things are
in good shape when these incidents happen. Brian reply’s by saying “I’m very
proud of what we accomplished over two years at the t. I’m very proud of what we
accomplished at the t in terms of getting the budget balanced getting costs
under control. He then claims the globe said his leadership in the fmcb was the
best thing to ever happen to the t. He really likes to overstate his
accomplishments. See a pattern?  He concludes by saying “Operating costs are
completely out of control. They’ve added a billion dollars of spending at the t
&amp; the t is delivering a third of the trips it was when I ran the
organization, so I would say the t’s got to get its costs under control. In 2024
there were more derailments on the mbta than any other major transit in the
country. That was in 2024, so I think governor Healey &amp; Phil Eng have a lot
of work getting costs under control &amp; improving the safety record. Im very
proud of what we accomplished in 2015 &amp; 16.”   You can see the video here.
The section on the t starts at 7:17. Its a train wreck.

To have a busy regional rail system in 2025 where - for the most part -
passenger car doors have to be manually opened and closed by conductors is a
little embarrassing.   This issue creates the most problems during off-peak
times. I’ve stood on platforms with fellow passengers hustling up and down the
platform trying to figure out how and where to board, trying to locate the
conductor, etc. I’ve even seen folks who don’t know any better try to reach up
and open doors from the outside themselves. Obviously you’re not supposed to do
that, but apart from the conductors’ shouted instructions, there is often no
signage or automated announcements telling people how and where to board.
Getting off the train at a non-terminus station can also be a mess. Passengers
don’t know where the conductor is, people are whipping their heads around trying
to clock where other passengers are going to get off the train, and once the
train stops, passengers are hustling down the aisles from car to car trying to
find the conductor or the nearest open door - again with little to no signage.
Sometimes conductors will announce that passengers can only exit the train at a
door manned by the conductor, but that doesn’t tell people much if you haven’t
seen the conductor for the last 20 minutes and have no idea where they/their
door is in relation to where you are on the train. And the P.A. systems are
frequently spotty.  If Amtrak can have fully automatic doors in 50-year old
Amfleet cars, how has the MBTA/Keolis not figured this out?

We all know that the MBTA is not perfect. BUT, passengers need to pay attention
and not add to the MBTA challenges.   Today, an overhead announcement was made
that the train would be express from Coolidge Corner to Saint Mary’s (yay!!).
Train was already behind schedule due to door issues. At around Kent Street some
woman starts bitching that the train missed her stop. She gets in the
conductor’s space and says he needs to stop. The guy is trying to drive a train
and this woman is disturbing him while he’s trying to work. He says to her that
the train is expressed St. Mary’s. She starts bitching at him that the
announcement wasn’t loud enough.  He stops at the next stop to let her off
because of her bitching and a bunch of other people get off. They all did not
realize the train was not express.    PEOPLE: take your air pods out of your

Although oddly not mentioned in the belowT presser, it looks like some TOD
housing is being added near the newly upgraded North Wilmington CR Station. And
that's a good thing to see.   That begs the question, given the T has a limited
budget for upgrading stations to full level/accessible boarding platforms, how
does the T prioritize which stations are next on the upgrade list?  Seems like
towns that should get it first should be ones that commit (issues permits) for
developing new housing and commercial/retail above/around the stations, even
beyond the 3A requirements.  Does this already happen?

job ) etc etc when syringes and people OD in the PUBLIC bathroom. This issue in
totality is not there issue they sell tickets. Nobody should feel unsafe at work
&amp; and the ones that are making these employees feel like this are people on
drugs and homeless that don’t work but get to just hang around north station ,
I’m assuming it’s probably like this at south station as well but I commute from
North station so it’s what I see. I don’t particularly love the new way things
are with fair gates and all that but I know who’s fault it’s definitely not and
that’s the employees just doing there job and being told what to do by
management again I’m just assuming by how companies work. I think these
employees are very fair , nice , kind and will help you if you need it and again
I witness this . So my question is what’s the issue and what am I missing , is
it Transit police  , Massachusetts, is it TD Bank Garden ??? Why can drug use be
so out in the open like this , &amp; nobody is doing anything? I feel like I’m
in bizzaro world where they have the rights and they are holding everyone
hostage. What is going on????

Just saw all of the tap-to-pay machines at the main Harvard entrance down
(saying that they are “out-of-service”) expect for one gate that was opened. One
machine had the “Tap the New CharlieCard” sign, so Cubic/The MBTA may be
possibly starting the testing phase of the new CharlieCards (or it is a
glitch/issue with the internals of the machines).   Does anyone know what could
cause the machines to go down? They seem to be working at the Church Street
entrance.

I don't usually use the new credit card readers, since I  get the monthly pass
and use my Charlie Card. However, I lost my Charlie Card on my way to work the
other day, and I decided to just pay the fares until I could get a replacement
card. I tried using my Samsung Pay to get in and go home, but it rejected it. I
checked my bank statement and I had plenty of money in my account. I then tried
using my debit card and it didn't work. I had to go to the fare machines to get
a Charlie Ticket, which did accept my debit card. I had the same issue the next
morning and called my bank to ask about it. They saw that the transaction was
attempted, but they told me they were not responsible for the issue. So, then I
assume it must be the card readers. Has anyone else had a similar issue?  Also,
can we please get a Charlie Card app or let the Charlie Card onto mobile
wallets?!

Not sure how many of you takes that train but every time orange line departs
south bound from Mass Ave there is just a jerky stop-start motion it makes. Is
the T going to fix that? Also the third rail sparks 100% of the time between
Mass Ave and Ruggles.

did tap at that time but the second one is false and after this I haven’t been

Yesterday I was riding the Haverhill line to Lawrence and all the automated
robo-announcements were correct, until we got to Lawrence. The automated voice
announced Lawrence as Lowell twice. Of course, Lowell isn't a stop on the
Haverhill line so I was curious how this mistake could have happened? Do
conductors select each station name (perhaps mistakenly selecting Lowell instead
of Lawrence) or is it fully automated? It didn't cause me any issues, other than
momentarily panicking thinking I was on the wrong line, but I'm super curious.

ticket from the machine in the subway area. But I dont know if this is normal.
Are the paper tickets still usable after being used? No one punched my ticket
&amp; I asked the conductor if its technically possible to get a round trip on
one ticket. They said ticket punches are for this reason. Whats stopping someone
from doing this if no one chekcs tickets? Also heads up for those looking to buy
paper tickets for the cr from the ticket machines. The location in the main
lobby isn't obvious. You have to walk all the way to the end &amp; head over to
the mcdonalds area. You could also get them from the subway area. Just a heads

Do they count household income or your individual income? I can see how some
people like students who live with parents would have issues being approved
because of their parents incomes. It seems to defeat the point of offering the
card. If you're a student whos not making a ton of money, shouldn't you be
approved anyways? We should encourage people to take transit when they can. When
I was a college student, I worked 2 days a week on campus &amp; struggled to
afford the t fare, especially the cr, unless it was a weekend. Granted, I did
get my share of free rides, but still, we should make transit accessible for all
income levels.

Its no secret being a cr conductor with keolis is rough. With long hours &amp;
low salaries, why are we unable to be like nyc? I dont think I've heard of this
being an issue with nycs commuter rail operators. Is it just a better experience
at LIRR &amp; MN? Google says LIRR conductor salaries can be around  66k. Metro
north is around 80k from what im seeing. I'm getting different numbers about
keolis but they range from 47-73k. If keolis improved the pay could they attract
more workers or would a new operator need to come in to make that kind of
difference? Or is it something else entirely that needs to be changed to make us
competitive with nyc?

Title: ⚠️ BREAKING NEWS | MBTA to begin enforcement of fare on Red, Blue, Green, and Orange Lines beginning Sept. 8th.

Posted: 2025-08-21 19:14:24 UTC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting Sept. 8th, the MBTA will begin deploying Fare Engagement
Representatives across the subway system to prevent riders from piggybacking
paying riders or jumping fare gates. Transit Police will also be deployed to
assist Fare Engagement Representatives in case of an emergency or belligerent
rider.  Fare Engagement Representatives will be patrolling high-traffic stations
and watching for violations. They will also be onboard Red, Blue, and Orange
Lines trains to validate fares on machines. Passengers will be required to tap
their mobile wallet, payment card, or CharlieCard to validate that they paid
their fare.  The MBTA said this is an ongoing effort to provide a safe system
and to support ongoing maintenance across the system (the MBTA has estimated
that they have lost thousands of dollars annually due to fare evasion across the
entire MBTA system).    VIA THE MBTA:  **WHAT ARE THE F.E.R?**  * Fare
Engagement Representatives wear blue shirts, khaki pants, hats, have MBTA
identification, and have access to Google Translate at all times (the majority
of Representatives speak a second language in addition to English).   * They
will enforce payment of subway and bus fares, support riders who may need help
paying their fare, and provide general travel assistance.  * Fare Engagement
Representatives will be deployed based on ridership, not geography, to prevent
potential racism and discriminatory targeting of riders. They have also been
trained in cultural sensitivity, de-escalation strategies, implicit bias, and
data collection transparency.  * Future phases of the Fare Engagement Program
will include Representatives onboard buses, Green Line trolleys, and Mattapan
Line trolleys to verify fare payment and provide riders fare education.
**HOW WILL FARE EVASION BE PROSECUTED?**  * Riders who are caught fare evading
will receive a formal warning on paper with a reiteration of paying their fare.
* Riders who continue to fare evade after being warned will be charged a $50
fine for their first three evasion, then a $100 fine for any subsequent evasion.
* Fines may go up to $150, depending on the severity of the charge.  * Riders
will be required to provide a government-issued identification (such as a
driver’s license or passport) or their name, their phone number, and address to
the Fare Engagement Representative. A citation/fine will be issued to the
rider’s address and provided in-person.  * After passengers are fined/cited,
they will be allowed to continue riding unless they become noncompliant.   *
Riders who become aggressive or noncompliant (i.e: not providing ID or name when
asked) will be asked to leave the station/train or face an arrest/fine for
trespassing.   **WHAT ABOUT USING SOMEONE ELSE’S REDUCED FARE CARD?**  * This
will also result in a fine/citation and is more severe.   * First time offenders
will receive a warning and the reduced fare card will be taken away.   * The
first 3 citations will result in a $75 dollar fine. Subsequent citations will
result in a $150 fine.  **HOW CAN I PAY/WAIVE A FARE?**  * You can pay online,
calling 1-800-941-9716, or sending a check to the MBTA.  * Riders who cannot pay
their fine can have it waived due to financial difficulties by writing an appeal
to the MBTA or attend an appeal hearing with a MBTA representative.  * Riders
asking for an appeal hearing must attend it and provide any needed
documentation. The MBTA will then provide a ruling within 60 by mail/email.  *
If you receive a fine/citation before enrolling in a reduced fare program, you
may have your citation/fare waived.

I been riding the Middleborough/Lakeville line for a few years now and have
never seen so many juveniles onboard since after the New Bedford/Fall River line
has open. I'm 100% not surprised this happened today and was pretty much calling
it when we got on the train today, the car we boarded in had 6-7 bikes alone.
Pilled in the handicap seats so much that we couldn't even go up the stairs to
the second floor. This has been a constant issue since the train has been going
to New Bedford, the fall river trains don't seem to have this issue as badly.
The conductor also doesn't seem to enforce what is considered a "bike either"
especially as someone had a gas motor bike running thru South station that got
off our train. Bikes should be for people who using them to commute not for
juveniles without parents to go into the city and cause chaos. I wish the MBTA
would just ban bikes on all south side trains but I know that isn't fare for
people who actually use the bikes how they supposed to. I think there needs to
be a lot more enforcement of juveniles without parents getting onboard
especially with bikes. And again this isn't the first and will probably be the
last time the train is like this, almost every weekend it's been like this and
it's mostly caused me not to ride because I don't really feel safe especially
when they start riding around on the platforms and in the main hall. The
security at South station is a joke and really need something like NYC where
they have national guard members to make sure this stuff doesn't happen. Not to
mention the MBTA just doesn't take care of South station either. I complained to
the MBTA today about this but maybe this being in the news will make them
finally act on this issue. Have anyone else experience this on there trains or
lines?

A cbs article from the other day said there were a few proposed ballot questions
related to transportation. Unless they get the required amount of signatures,
these questions wouldn't appear on the ballot so keep that in mind since
nothings set in stone. They include repealing the mbta zoning law &amp; the gas
tax. If this were to make to the ballot &amp; pass, would the funding issues
really be changed at all? The thinking in years past was that the gas tax would
be a consistent revenue source. Thats obviously not panned out &amp; with the
introduction of evs, I dont see it being sustainable. What other funding sources
could we try to look at in the future that are relatively stable alternatives?
Lastly, if they succeeded in passing an appeal to the zoning law, wouldn't that
be impossible since the sjc ruled it was constitutional?

It seems Iike the people who have no clue what they’re talking about when they
blame Eng for every issue in the last 25 years are posting more here. I’m
convinced it’s a few bitter employees disgruntled about something or other
creating a bunch of handles to astroturf the place. He’s not been without fault,
but he runs laps around the Baker administration appointees.  Note: The GM of
the T isn’t responsible for (Amtrak) catenary falling on a signal bungalow and
setting it on fire, or 95-degree days leading to track warping, or a bus engine
going kaput in the middle of a run. I feel like Eng has addressed the
low-hanging fruit items that were ignored for years. Now comes the hard stuff,
including changing the culture of the agency. Stop settling for hitting singles
and take some big swings on a few projects, whether it’s SCR Phase II or more
double tracking or something else.

Dear mods this will be about service to the Cape though it does cover MBTA
regions such as Providence and Taunton. While not directly it should be allowed
as it increases feasibility of train service to the Cape and encouraging better
transit service in Mass. In general Supporting train projects throughout the
state is a great way to increase overall viability. IE a successful relaunch of
this service can encourage state to make upgrade to Cape Bridge that will make
things such as year round Cape Flyer service viable.     As per stops wise they
would be mostly the same ie:  NYC (will cover this later on), New Haven, New
London, Taunton, Buzzards Bay, Yarmouth, &amp; Hyannis.  So what would it take
and can this be done in a way that won't hurt Cape Flyer service?  First this
type of service would require approval from Army Corps of Engineer for bridge
access. In an ideal world Mass DOT would purchase the bridge with an agreement
to maintain it etc but not sure how feasible this is.   Next would any track
work be required on Cape to support this? Would Hyannis station area require
additional track work to store both the Amtrak service and Cape Flyer in the
summer?   The train would mostly be on NEC rail but then use Middleboro
subdivision line. What is the condition of this track and would additional work
be required?  NYC side this is where it gets tricky. The pervious Cape Codder
operated out of Grand Central. Is this still an option? NYP could possibly work
but the issue there would be East River tunnel slots. Even running off peak is
tricky as that time is important for track work. This to me is the hardest part
to figure out.  What do people here think of this idea overall? Would you be
supportive of MassDOT and Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority attempting to
relaunch this in partnership with Amtrak?

I read an interesting article on Massterlist today. It mentions several
companies that attended an "Industry Day" hosted by the MBTA in May. Those
companies include, but are not limited to: Alstom, Deutsche Bahn, Transport UK,
Transdev, Herzog, and Alternate Concepts Inc., the company headed by James
O’Leary, who lost the current contract to Keolis Commuter Rail Services in 2014.
(I believe O'Leary used to run Massachusetts Bay Commuter Rail Company).
Additonally, I found it interesting that Keolis has spent $430,000 on lobbyists,
making them one of the top spenders on Beacon Hill.   How likely is it a new
operator would be awarded the contract? Is it likely to change things for the
positive or are the issues most of us experience more structural with the MBTA
itself? What do you think of the current pool we know of?

“The current operator is in the process of procuring seven leased
battery-electric multiple-units for use on the 15 km Fairmount Line. The next
operator will support the acquisition and operation of the BEMUs, **and at the
request of MBTA would procure additional rolling stock.**”  This is minor update
to the future MBTA CR contract agreement. Several months ago, the MBTA confirmed
that regional rail upgrades would *not* be issued within the next operations
contract. However, it seems like the next operators will now be responsible for
all rolling stock procurement going forward, following in the footsteps of the
current BEMU agreement with Keolis.

Walking into North Station around 5:35, hustling to make it to the boarding area
in time for the 5:42 train back to Lowell I was approached by two young men who
were handing out flyers. I was clearly in a rush, sweating profusely, but they
approached me anyways. I didn’t engage or make eye contact, but they started
yelling “come on man” and I said “Sorry I’m not interested.”   One of them
proceeded to grab me by the arm as I was trying to get into the fare gate and I
again said “Sorry I’m not interested” a little bit louder and they started
laughing after that and as I was trying to get my phone to read with my train
pass.   I’ve been taking the train every day for about six months and never had
any issues, but this definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. No employees in
sight, if they did this to me, I’m sure they harassed others too.   Is there
something I can do to prevent this from happening in the future? Any tips for
safety? Not really sure what I’m looking for, just wanted to get it off my

 I recently read a post here about scr &amp; how the old colony lines have a
congestion issue. Buried in the comments was a mention of how the red line was
built to bypass Dorchester &amp; other minority areas. That got me thinking
about the impacts of transit equality &amp; I decided to make this post. Do you
think the t has done a good job with improving transit in an equitable way?
There's been a focus on environmental justice communities for example with some
upcoming projects like better bus service along parts of the north shore to
improve transit access &amp; bemus on the fairmount line to cut back on
pollution in a majority black neighborhood. There's also other ways this is
being done like with the newer reduced fare options for those who qualify. As a
person with a qualifying disability, I was eligible for the transportation
access pass, allowing me to afford the t fares more easily. I personally think
the north shore improving bus routes &amp; better acces to reduced fares is
equitable, but im not an expert in this area. If it dosent count lmk. Do you
think these are good ideas or should more be done to make transit equitable for
everyone? If more should be done, what are realistic ways to make it a reality?

Title: ‘It’s fricking hot!’ Passengers endure sweltering heat inside T stations.

MBTA riders complained of insufferable conditions inside T stations as
temperatures climbed toward 100 degrees in Boston today.  The National Weather
Service has placed the city and much of Massachusetts under an [extreme heat
warning](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2025-06-24/gbh-daily-too-too-hot).
Mayor Michelle Wu declared a heat emergency for the city through Tuesday.  At
Park Street Station, where temperatures are [known to top 100
degrees](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2024-07-17/mbta-stations-exceed-100-degrees-in-downtown-boston-due-to-extreme-heat) when
it’s only in the 90s outdoors, commuters were confronted with hot, humid and
stale air this morning.  “It’s fricking hot!” said Brockton resident Debbie
Scott, who stood in front of a fan with sweat beading on her forehead as she
waited for a train. Scott appreciated that there were several fans placed
throughout the station to help provide relief to passengers, but she said they
weren’t enough.  Her message to T leaders? “Come down here and try to take a
train down here and see how hot it is for real!”  Alex Boruchgeruszeki, a recent
transplant to Boston, compared the T station to other subway systems he’s used
around the globe. He had one word to describe the stale air: boiling.  “Here
it’s probably the most uncomfortable of the metro stations that I’ve been in,”
he said. “Something must be done for this city.”  The MBTA on Monday [issued an
advisory](https://www.mbta.com/news/2025-06-23/mbta-prepares-extreme-heat) to
passengers warning of the extreme heat, saying that the agency has stationed
crews “around the system to provide assistance” to riders in need. The advisory
also warned that skyrocketing temperatures could lead to operational issues.
“The MBTA may need to operate trains at reduced speeds in some areas to ensure
safety as we compensate for heat-related stress on the tracks, which could
result in slightly longer travel times,” the agency said.  The T did not
immediately respond to an email asking for additional details about the
assistance being offered but said that they are planning a surprise for Blue
Line riders to help them beat the heat.  “MBTA staff will hand out cool treats
to riders at Maverick later today,” spokeswoman Lisa Battiston said in an email.
“The MBTA’s Customer and Employee Experience team is also planning additional
surprises all summer long to express our appreciation for our riders.”

When extreme heat occurs, the rail may expand due to added stress, which may
result in unusable rail or severe damage to infrastructure.   Because of this,
the MBTA may run at slower speeds for the safety of operators and customers on
all rail services (subway, trolley, and Commuter Rail) to avoid a possible
derailment.   There is also a potential for damage to the overhead catenary on
the Mattapan and Green Lines due to the extreme heat. Extreme heat can cause the
overhead wires to expand and sag downward, which can then lead to downed wires
and other electrical issues.   The MBTA is asking bus riders to keep all windows
closed today to allow for the AC to cool the bus down across the entire vehicle.
Staff will also be commissioned across the system to monitor rail
infrastructure, make emergency repairs, and provide medical support in case of a
heatstroke or severe dehydration.  The MBTA is also asking riders to report hot
vehicles to them by alerting the operator, contacting them on social media, or
reporting it on the Customer Feedback Form. Make sure to include the vehicle
number (the 4 digit code at the ends of all trains cars).

As someone from Los Angeles, our transit has historically been....pretty
mediocre. Fortunately, that has changed a lot in recent years, as we've built a
sizable metro system from scratch in the span of 35 years, and have further
expansions and upgrades on the horizon coming soon, largely thanks to a
half-cent sales tax measure called Measure M, which will fund major transit
expansion projects in the coming decades.  That being said, I wonder how the
situation is in the other major cities in the United States.  Boston has the
distinction of being the very first US city to ever build a subway, pre-dating
cities like even NYC and Chicago, however I have heard there have been problems
in more recent years with maintenance and upkeep, though I've also heard that
those issues have largely been resolved.  That said, I want to hear from you
locals on your view of MBTA's future.  On a scale of 1-5:  1 - very pessimistic
2 - somewhat pessimistic  3 - neither optimistic or pessimistic  4 - somewhat
optimistic  5 - very optimistic  How do you feel about Boston's public transit
future in the next 20-30 years? This is all relative of course, so it's up to
you.

While the GLX has been incredibly useful, I think that most can agree that being
just two branches of the Green Line with only one service per branch, that
service is relatively lacking for such a dense section of Somerville and
Medford.  Wait times can be long, and during the morning and evening rush,
trains are very crowded. In addition, due to traffic in the central subway and
street-running on the E branch, reliability (manifesting as bunching and
unexpected "express" trains) is a problem too. The areas served by the GLX will
continue to densify, so these issues are not going away, but will only get worse
with time.  With that being said, what no-build or minimal-build (&lt;$200M?)
changes can be made in the near-to-medium term to improve this situation?

do you repeat the same mistakes. I only wish I place a bet yesterday know you’d
have trouble today. Green line signal issues. Seriously? And, please stop
collecting tolls when the train ain’t running. That’s a form of theft. Not
delivering services promised after accepting payment.

I don’t know if the MBTA has any of these between subway stations, but what I’m
suggesting is simply a free transfer between Charles/MGH and Bowdoin / Govt
Center as if the second service were a bus route (which would be a free
transfer).   MTA has a few of these where you have to get out of the station,
walk a short bit, use metro card to get free transfer within 15 mins. It’s not a
substitute for the real thing of course but it’s extremely easy and inexpensive
to implement and it solves a fairness issue for folks who’d otherwise be paying
a double fare.  I almost feel like it already works this way, ?! I can’t imagine
what the downside could be. It would be interesting to see the data, if
implementing the free transfer results in people finding that connection useful.
For that matter, not like it’s a priority, but it’d be real nice if MBTA could
implement something similar for instances when customers enter fare gates at a
station where the platforms aren’t connected and if you accidentally enter the
wrong side you have no option but to leave and pay again. MTA has this same
situation happening at many of the old IRT (numbered train) local stations in
Manhattan. It was the first part of the system built, simplest stations.

Hi, new in town (moved here in Nov), take the T everywhere, but I've noticed
over the past 2 weeks train service has been way more spotty; I know there's
signal work on the Orange Line but the Red Line has been really spotty as
well—CONSTANT stops all the time, and rn I'm waiting in Central station to
travel home and both the Ashmont and Braintree trains are stopped (the one 4
stops away the other 1 stop away).  I normally take the Red Line and notice the
train has stopped for like 10 minutes outside of JFK/UMass several times. In the
context of the Red Line does anyone know why there're all these issues all of a
sudden?

willing and able – please sit yourself! no harm in taking a seat after a long

happening this year and it has become a major pet peeve of mine.   edit: wow
lots of comments! I think my issue is less with people not wanting to sit but
more unaware riders, with their head down and headphones. I will be holding my
backpack in one hand, desperately reaching for a poll (I have poor balance lol),
and I sometimes don't have a free hand to literally poke somebody because they
didn't hear me say "hey excuse me may I sit here?"   I think it's just something
to deal with and I appreciate the comments! it seems strange to me to commandeer
an individual seat by standing over it with your back turned but it's the city!

train. But when I showed up to the station, both the screens and the MBTA
website showed 37 minutes til the next Braintree train. I panicked and nearly
got an Uber, but the screens updated five minutes later. What’s going on, and is
this typical for early morning trains? Or does this have to do with the signal

This graph by StreetsBlog Mass shows the different proposals by Gov. Healey, the
Massachusetts House, and Massachusetts Senate.  The Massachusetts House would
send $793 million dollars to the MBTA in the surtax-backed supplemental budget,
while the Massachusetts Senate would send $370 million under a plan by the
Senate Ways and Means Committee, headed by Senate Michael Rodrigues. The House
budget passed 140-14. The Senate will debate their own version of the budget
starting tomorrow, with final amendments required to be submitted by Monday.
AS REPORTED BY BANKER AND TELLERMAN:  * “The MBTA under the Senate Ways and
Means proposal would receive $200 million for its savings account, $100 million
for workforce and safety training, $50 million for commuter rail system
maintenance and upgrades, and $20 million for reduced fares for low-income
riders.  * “The House bill’s MBTA investments included $400 million for
workforce and safety investments, $300 million for the agency’s savings account,
$60 million for “physical infrastructure,” $20 million for reduced fares and $13
million for Sumner Tunnel reimbursements. “  If the Senate version of their bill
passes, including the decreased surtax budget to the MBTA, it will then be sent
back to the House Conference Meeting, where the House and Senate will meet to
discuss any issues either side may have. Once finalized, the Conference
Committee Report will be sent to Gov. Healey for approval or veto.

The proposed CIP from March has 8M to be spent on temporary platforms at
Foxboro, as well as other stations (doesn’t name others) for “special events”,
which I can assume is the World Cup. How exactly are these going to be built? I
thought all new stations had to be high level unless freight clearance is an
issue, so unless they are getting an exception, they have to build new high
level platforms. It took about a year for Lynn’s temporary platforms to be built
after design had finished, and those only fit like 2 cars (and I assume they
will need the full 800’ for game day trains). I haven’t heard anything about
those even being in the design process, and the World Cup is just over a year
away. I just don’t see how those are going to be built in time, unless there is
something I don’t know.

scr, how will they manage to build out regional rail? I wanted to be optimistic
about it &amp; im beginning to think they cant do it. I think a new company
needs to come in with fresh eyes. They also lack transparency with the fairmount

I understand the t is installing new platforms for accessible boarding at some

transit modes dont have this issue. The buses are able to lower ramps &amp; have
dedicated seating areas for those who need it. The subways are more complicated
but are accessible. Why couldn't we use retractable ramps like the gl/bus for
low level stations &amp; then have a mezzanine area like we do on now on the cr.
If that's not practical, what could be a better solution?  Im not well versed in
how this works so insight is appreciated. Also how would this impact procurement

better funding for our transit networks.  Transit is a necessity. We need to
issue bonds, consider increasing taxes, or find other revenue streams to fund

Metrolinx, the transit agency serving the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, has
entered into a significant public-private partnership (P3) with ONxpress
Transportation Partners. This consortium is tasked with designing, building,
operating, and maintaining a more frequent and faster transit network over a
23-year term starting January 1, 2025. The project includes adding over 124
miles of new rail track and electrifying over 373 miles of existing track (one
note of caution: more recently, portions of the network have seen
electrification scaled back, indefinitely postponed, or shifted toward relying
on dual-mode locomotives at the very least). ONxpress is also rebuilding many GO
Transit stations, which is something the MBTA has notably struggled with in
recent years.   In Massachusetts, the MBTA has been considering similar
approaches. In December 2023, the MBTA issued a Request for Information (RFI) to
explore the possibility of a public-private partnership for future commuter rail
operations, with the goal of advancing regional rail improvements. The MBTA will
make a decision on how to structure the next contract within the next few months
from now. This is all without evening mentioning the current agreement with
Keolis as a PDP for the Fairmount electrification project.   Given these
developments, should the MBTA pursue a P3 agreement similar to Metrolinx’s
partnership with ONxpress to achieve its regional rail improvement goals?

Freight companies own some of the track &amp; obviously prioritize their own

one](https://burley.com/products/flatbed?variant=42006769893572&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvBHadXVs8lIOTm2x6Kn9MpZZVQGF7W_oRSUr9mm9dWtgR9dOkw853xoCWGAQAvD_BwE).
Flattened it's 33 x 24.8 x 4.2 in inches or 84 x 63 x 10.7 in cm. Could I stow
it with the bikes or under my seat?  Edit: The bike trailer will be dismantled.
The wheels will be removed as will the handlebars. The big issue is the length
as it will still be 3ft. If I took the early train would they be willing to let
me stow it in the same area as the bikes.  The below picture is what it ill look
like dismantled.

Thanks for any help. I've never taken the commuter rail before.

What’s with the T staff not letting anyone pass until you scan your ticket in
the foyer area heading to the trains at South Station? Why are they doing that?
Also isn’t that like a public area, shouldn’t they be doing it closer to the
actual track area? I just find it annoying. Aren’t there bigger issues to focus
on besides fare evasion? And no offense to CR staff, but what’s the point of
having like 3 of them on the trains to scan tickets if I’ve already had to scan
mine to get through to the train.

Hello, everyone. I hope that everyone’s week has been going well.  Today, I
would like to comment on 2 posts that had been shared on the r/mbta subreddit
regarding a teenager (supposedly aged 16) being body-slammed by an adult after
refusing to not smoke weed on a Red Lien train at JFK/UMass and another person
smoking weed on the Red Line.  We have seen an increase in users condoning the
violence that the teenager faced or worse, being generally rude/inappropriate,
saying racist things, etc.   The Moderation Team will not tolerate any of these
behaviors in posts or comments. Discussions about a topic should remain about
the issue at hand while being mature and civil. You are allowed to argue your
own point, as long as it doesn’t violate any subreddit or website
guidelines/rules and remains respectful of all other members.  When people
decide to say that a 16 year old kid should have been assaulted, or be racist,
or be rude to each other, it takes away from any meaningful conversation that
could help prevent such situations in the first place. Violence is NEVER okay
(unless your life is in grave danger), especially against a literal child. There
are better ways to address the situation than trying to be a vigilante; that is
why we have Transit Police and intercom machines. It puts you, the train, other
passengers, and the person you are assaulting in danger. It is not worth it.
The Moderation Team will continue to look at both posts in question and remove
comments that violate Reddit or r/mbta rules. If people continue to repeat
behaviors that have been mentioned before, we will have to begin banning people;
we would rather not have to do that. We want the subreddit to monitor itself,
but we will step in if things become unmanageable.  TLDR: Please stop advocating
for the violence of a teenager or being inappropriate; this is a subreddit to
have meaningful conversations regarding public transit, and threats/comments
like this does not contribute to this goal. Those who continue to do so will
have comments removed.  Signed,   Holiday,  Moderator of r/mbta

The Longwood Circulation Study will specifically look at the current state of
bus service in the Longwood Medical Area (served by routes such as 8 and 19) and
provide recommendations regarding new bus stops, rerouting of nearby bus routes,
and construction of bus lanes and/ore redesign of roads.   The MBTA will expand
this study to nearby Green and Orange Line stations (such as Ruggles, Brigham
Circle, Longwood Medical Area, and Roxbury Crossing) to evaluate connections to
other services, but concentration of the study will be done in the immediate
LMA).  This study will officially begin in Winter 2025, and the MBTA will
produce 4 recommendations for possible bus reroutes and infrastructure
improvements that the public will be allowed to discuss and give input on
throughout 2026. The MBTA plans to release the final report of the LMA study in
Winter 2026 with any recommendations that they decide on. The MBTA will also
document current issues with bus service in the LMA region later this spring.

Saw this article posted on r/transit &amp; it got me thinking.   "a $770 million
budget deficit threatens thousands of jobs, sweeping service cuts and a crater
in the local economy if a financial fix isn’t found by spring.  That is the
picture in a report released Friday by the Regional Transportation Authority,
which oversees finances for the region’s buses and rail agencies. The report
outlines the dire effects that a failure to plug the gap could have on the
system and the region. The General Assembly, the authority said, needs to act by
the end of the legislative session in May in order to stave off a crisis."
Sound familiar?  We were able to overcome our potential issues with revenue. I
absolutely agree we need a better longterm solution,  but we did figure
something out. Why is Chicago different? I've never been to Chicago so I don't
have experience or insight into how they work. Also just wanted to point out
that their subway &amp; bus system is under cta, but Metra runs commuter rail
&amp; there's also pace, the suburban bus system. All of these entities are
overseen by the rta. I know around here we look at them at face value of
literally only being for certain regions. I don't know why things are different
over there. Just wanted to add that detail.

Title: When type 8s are retired, could D line return to 50mph?

Given the plans to return the red and orange lines to their original speeds, do
you think it's possible we could ever see the D line return to 50mph once the
type 8s are retired? Would love to see that old "35 minutes to Park Street" sign
become a reality.  There could be other reasons I'm unaware of, so correct me if
I'm missing something, but my understanding is that we only go 35mph because of
the type 8s tendency to derail at higher speeds, thanks to being rushed for ADA
compliance. If that's the case, what do you think are the odds we get a speed
increase on the D line once the 10s finally replace the old fleet?  I also
anticipated a couple of issues/concerns people might have with this. Let me know
if there's any I missed, or just your thoughts on these:  1. Would the central
subway's bottleneck be even worse with a faster speed limit aboveground? Would
this just make headways worse?    * Are there any unutilized tracks in the
central subway that could be revived as express tracks? Could more turn around
at Kenmore to mitigate this? Maybe it just wouldn't be an issue? 2. Would people
get mad about "wasting" limited budget space on upgrades that would mostly
benefit Newton and Brookline? Or do western suburbs only get flak when it comes
to the CR? Or am I just giving too much thought to the opinions of a minority I
see in comments from time to time?    * I'm not fully sure how serious people
are when they complain about western suburbs getting upgrades. But if they
actually had an issue with this specific plan, my counterpoint would be that
raising the speed would benefit everyone because it would increase ridership,
take more cars off the roads (this does have a greater impact on transit and
funding when it's Newton and Brookline choosing GL over driving), and increase
fare revenue. This assumes we can avoid the headway concerns I mentioned above,
which is kind of a big assumption. But the D line has already gotten a lot
better since fixing the slow zones, and I have switched back to it from the
Needham CR I took last year.

Title: BREAKING NEWS | State watchdog agency calls out MBTA and Keolis over running of the Commuter Rail, failure to collect fares in new report by State Auditor DiZoglio and Inspector General Shapiro.

Posted: 2025-03-05 00:53:59 UTC
Post ID: 1j3qqkt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPORTED BY BOSTON GLOBE:  Shapiro penned a public letter to MBTA general
manager Phil Eng urging action to improve fare collection on commuter rail
trains. Less than an hour later, DiZoglio’s office published a 70-page audit
report that the Methuen Democrat said found “significant issues that need to be
remedied” in the contract with Keolis.  Shapiro said he believes the scale of
uncollected fares on commuter rail trains, and the revenue lost as a result,
“has been greatly understated over the years.” He reported that, anecdotally,
staff in the inspector general’s office tracked how often their fares were
collected while riding trains to and from South Station in 2024 and found
significant fluctuation. Every rider from the inspector general’s office took at
least one commuter rail trip during which a conductor did not collect a fare,
Shapiro said.  “In many ways, the MBTA has not prioritized fare collection, as
demonstrated by the lack of infrastructure to achieve that goal and the
treatment of fare collection as an element of the passenger experience rather
than the necessary revenue driver it should be,” he wrote. “The MBTA incorrectly
focuses on fare evasion, when it should instead enforce the contract
requirements of active fare collection by its commuter rail operator. While the
lost revenue from uncollected fares would not close the MBTA’s projected budget
gap, the impact of uncollected fares is significant. How the MBTA leadership and
staff treat one public dollar is as meaningful as how they treat a million
dollars. Each dollar must count.”  The contract allows the T to impose penalties
on Keolis if the company fails to collect fares at expected levels. However,
Shapiro argued that the penalties are too low at $500 per failure, compared to
$1,000 fines for poor vehicle performance or $2,000 fines for station
cleanliness issues.  Shapiro noted that a 2017 agreement between the T and
Keolis called for installation of fare gates at South Station, North Station and
Bay Bay Station, which officials at the time said would increase the T’s revenue
by $24 million.  “We are now in 2025, and the only commuter rail station with
fare gates is North Station,” Shapiro wrote. “The MBTA’s thinking about fare
gates and fare collection needs to change.”  T officials last year said fare
gates have not yet been installed at South Station because of ongoing
construction in air rights above the station. At the time, Eng said scans for
mobile mTickets increased more than 200 percent from September 2023 to September
2024.  DiZoglio’s probe, which her office says will be part of a series of
audits into the MBTA, found that the T mishandled performance-based incentives
and penalties outlined in its contract with Keolis. The errors diminish “the
overall quality and reliability of the MBTA’s commuter rail services,” the audit
said.  “In this instance, the MBTA failed to assess millions of dollars of
financial penalties that could have helped improve service for MBTA customers,”
the audit continued. “This represents a financial loss to the MBTA and could
lead to other financial losses, as poorer service may result in fewer riders.
Failure to properly assess incentives and penalties could also reduce the
public’s trust in the MBTA and harm its relationship with a vendor that relied
on the MBTA’s calculations of incentives and penalties.”  Across the audit
period from June 1, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2023, the MBTA failed to assess more
than $3.3 million in penalties and “inappropriately assessed” another roughly
$258,000 in penalties, based on metrics such as on-time performance, seat
availability, fleet maintenance and passenger comfort and amenities, the report
said. The MBTA overpaid Keolis $105,800 in performance-based incentives, with
the majority of that amount tied to an “inadvertent clerical error,” the audit
found. Keolis was also underpaid $105,210 for train staffing incentives.  In its
audit response, the MBTA said it has started to implement some of the auditor’s
recommendations to ensure the correct penalties and incentives are doled out to
Keolis. The MBTA also said it disagreed “with some of the SAO’s calculations and
interpretations of contract language.” “We look forward to working with the SAO
on how the MBTA can continue to improve to provide safe, reliable, and
accessible service to the MBTA’s customers and employees,” the MBTA said.
DiZoglio’s office said the MBTA did not properly oversee Keolis’s fare
collection efforts and maintain inspection documents. The audit further faulted
the MBTA for not ensuring Keolis submitted required reports on time dealing with
fare collection revenue and fleet maintenance. The MBTA didn’t charge Keolis
$255,000 for the tardy reports, the audit claimed.  “The MBTA disagrees that it
failed to ensure the Keolis submitted reports relating to fare collection
revenue and fleet maintenance on time and as such disagrees that any penalties
were appropriate to be assessed to Keolis,” the agency said in its response to
the audit.  The report made by Auditor DiZoglio can be found here:

Title: Why Are MBTA’s New Green Line Trains So Cramped Compared to Other Cities?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been trying to figure out why the MBTA’s new Type 9 and Type 10 Green Line
trains feel so cramped and claustrophobic—with huge interior wall bump-outs,
super recessed windows, and a narrow aisle that make them feel much smaller than
they should.  People often say it’s because “the tunnels are tight,” but that’s
just not true when you look at the numbers.  Comparison to Muni Metro (San
Francisco) – Size Isn’t the Issue  Muni Metro’s Siemens S200 SF trains—just like
the Green Line—run both underground and in mixed street traffic. Yet they feel
way more open, hold more passengers, and look much more modern.  📏 Train
Dimensions &amp; Capacity:          MBTA Type 9 (CAF USA)         •
Length: 74.5 feet         •       Width: 8.7 feet         •       Height: 12.5
feet         •       Seats: 54         •       Total Capacity: 191 passengers
Muni Metro Siemens S200 SF         •       Length: 75 feet (basically the same!)
•       Width: 8.5 feet (narrower than MBTA!)         •       Height: 11 feet
(shorter than MBTA!)         •       Seats: 60         •       Total Capacity:
203 passengers  So Muni’s trains are actually a little smaller, yet they hold
more passengers, feel way roomier, and don’t have these weird bulky wall panels.
Why Do MBTA’s New Trains Feel So Claustrophobic?  🚇 Some questionable design
choices: ✅ Huge wall bump-outs that shrink aisle space. ✅ Super recessed windows
that make the interior feel dark and enclosed. ✅ An inefficient seating layout
that somehow fits fewer people in a bigger train.  What’s actually inside those
wall bump-outs? Other cities don’t have them, and they make the trains feel much
tighter than they should.  Why Did the MBTA Choose This Design and Manufacturer?
Instead of going with a proven manufacturer like Siemens, the MBTA chose CAF
USA—a company with less experience in the U.S. market. Was this just about cost?
Politics? Something else?  This just feels like another example of the MBTA
delivering something that’s more expensive but worse than what other cities are
building. And unfortunately, it’s part of a pattern.  And don’t even get me
started on the new Green Line station designs—they have the same uninspired,
cost-cutting feel.  If anyone has insight into why the MBTA made these design
choices—or what’s inside those weird wall bump-outs—please explain it, because I
genuinely don’t get it.  Would love to hear from others—especially anyone who’s
ridden better-designed light rail systems.

It’a been discussed, but there was not formal confirmation I don’t think.
https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AxgSdcBf1/?mibextid=wwXIfr  From the MBTA
Department of System-wide Accessibility,   "Dear Riders,  We are writing to
inform you of a change to typical Subway Operations on the Red Line.
Specifically, the MBTA will begin periodically running shorter, four-car
trainsets to supplement the standard six-car trainsets.  Why is this happening?
The MBTA is in the process of retiring its oldest Red Line train cars. While new
Red Line cars continue to be received, there are not enough spare cars to
regularly meet service demands as a result, there may be instances when the MBTA
must run four-car trains to maintain current service levels, particularly during
peak A.M. and P.M. service hours.  When and how often will shorter trainsets be
deployed? This will largely depend on how many cars are available to be put into
passenger service, but riders can expect to find one to three shorter trainsets
in service during the weekday rush beginning over the course of the next few
weeks.    What steps will be taken to ensure a safe and positive experience for
all riders? We recognize that running a combination of six and four car
trainsets will be a significant change for riders – particularly for those who
regularly board cars towards the rear of the train. With this in mind, the
following steps will be taken:  As a shorter train car is approaching the
station, a message will be broadcast both audibly and visually letting riders
know the train will be shorter and that they should move towards the front of
the train while standing behind the yellow line, An additional MBTA employee
will be stationed in the rear car of the shorter trainsets. Their role will be
to scan the platform as the train enters the station and ensure that everyone
waiting towards the end of the platform is aware of the need to move further
down the platform to board. At high ridership stations, employees will be
present on the platform to ensure riders are aware of incoming shorter
trainsets. Have Any Questions? If you have any questions regarding this change,
please contact our Customer Service Center by calling 617-222-3200 (711 for TTY

Conductor stated there was a power issue with the first car. He ended up opening
a small door just outside the cab and turning it to bypass. Just curious - what
does this do? After much waiting, another MBTA operator walked all the way to
the third car to operate from there, but struggled to get the train to move. It
must have taken some thinking to fix as they ended up opening the front door of
the cab and letting two more instructors climb onboard from the tracks to
assist. Being this all took about 30 minutes and was intriguing to experience,
how does this work practically? Are all the traction motors active at the same
time or only the car where the operator sits? Or, can you operate from any
control stand at any time?

I live off the Braintree Branch and don’t have a car atm, commute to DTX for

a contractor for the T doing vehicle maintenance stats there were only ten #4
cars in the active fleet but there must be more now.  I just want to say it’s a
pleasure to be on the new cars. Recent posts from motorpersons and passengers
have brought up issues w the CRRC cars which seem valid, I agree with them,
especially the relative discomfort of the seats. But this feels grand, like I’m
back in NYC riding on one of the many new trains. Or like the OL (which I only
use occasionally) with the new #14s - but the spaciousness of the RL #4 is
dramatic. It’s like of like taking a lettered-route train in NYC (BMT/IND) if
you’re accustomed to the numbered trains (previously IRT) as everything inside
looks the same except the dimensions are obviously very different. In this
respect I’m talking about the width, how much space between the the seats on
either side. The new orange line cars are good but feel a little squeezed when
it’s busy ( let’s not blame the MBTA or CRRC for this).   Speaking of, I believe
in nyc they called the numbered routes the “A Division” and lettered routes the
“B Division” - some non official maps I’ve seen made by fellow trolley jollies
depict the RL branches using this same A / B nomenclature which I think is
sensible because Ashmont starts with A, Braintree with B. I grew up using
Alewife as my station to enter the system and never had been to Braintree,
Mattapan, Ashmont, so while this all seems simple enough to me now maybe “A” and
“B” would be simpler. The #3 RL cars seem to have the same side LCD displays as
the R42 old nyc trains also rehabbed in the 90s by Kawasaki (or Bombadier?) and
in nyc it shows the letter/number of route big and then the terminus -
Ashmont-bound trains in Boston show a big “A” there too but I’ve never seen them
use a “B” there. I never used the “south shore extension” when I was working for
the T so I never thought to ask.   My real point is that I could see the future
being bright when the RL fleet is finally new, even with all the issues of the
CRRC trains; if the orange line is an indication, it doesn’t seem to be a
disaster the way the Boeing LRVs were in the 80s, requiring replacement well
before end of planned life.

Title: Charlieticket issue tapping on buses? Not going through?

hey—has anyone ever had an issue with a Charlie ticket/monthly pass just… not
scanning on buses? It takes a while for it to scan/register or not go through at
all (ex.) card unreadable) usually bus drivers will just let me through, but so
far scans fine on the subways—- just buses so far.   I do keep it in my wallet,
so I’m not sure if that could be impacting it? Is it worth even replacing it? Or
is there something I can do to fix it before I resort to getting a replacement?

I just saw today that the PayByPhone app is tacking on a 30¢ service fee when I
pay for my Quincy Adams parking. Not sure why they decided to start doing it now
or if there’s been announcement but given that it is the only way to pay for
parking (aside for waiting for them to mail you a ticket) I feel like the price
shouldn’t be advertised as $9 anymore but $9.30 instead.   Edit: I reached out
and customer service said it was an issue with the app. They said I’d get a
refund (I guess automatically?)

The northern section of the red line has been noticeably slower than usual since
end of last week, with the train either waiting longer at stations, stopping
many times in between stations, or crawling along sections where it'd usually go
at full speed. This all happens even though there are no posted alerts, and
despite today's warmer weather. Is the signal system faulty somewhere, requiring
partially manual dispatching from the control center?

I was going through North Station after the Bruins game when I got on a
southbound Orange Line train. The train was being held because personnel
apparently were on the track at Forest Hills checking the rails — which I only
found out after I got off the train at DTX and heard the announcement on the
platform. The motorperson made about eight announcements telling us why we were
standing by, but I couldn’t hear them.   I got on a southbound CRRC Red Line
train later and the PA there was working fine. It seemed like there were plenty
of speakers located throughout the car. That train was also much less crowded,
so who knows.   Is it a matter of the operators not speaking into a microphone?
Adjusting the speaker volume to a lower setting? Or is equipment experiencing
problems? This is an ADA issue and while safe operating is the motorperson’s
main job, in-car announcements are important.    Edit: Wasn’t trying to
criticize operator, was legitimately trying to figure out what the issue may be.

like seeing data and knowing where the numbers come from.   FTA’s NTD data for
the MBTA can be found here:
https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/transit-agency-profiles/massachusetts-bay-transportation-authority
APTA’s data can be found here, note that I just took a simple average of all the
weeks in a year to get an average weekly ridership for the year:
https://transitapp.com/apta And then population stats were Census, via some
external sources like FRED. I’m more familiar with transit data than population
data to be honest, so apologies if those have issues!

Is your bus constantly getting stuck behind illegally parked delivery drivers,
Ubers/Lyfts, or just random people with their hazzard lights on? There's a bill
that has been passed by the Senate and the House that would allow buses to issue
fines to these vehicles via onboard cameras. It would also allow municipal
governments to install cameras at bus stops to issue fines to illegally parked
vehicles.   The only thing standing in its way now is the Governor. If you think
it is a good idea for bus lanes and bus stops to be clear of illegally parked
private and commercial vehicles, I would encourage you to reach out to the
Governor and let her know.   Email the Governor here: [email form

Hi all,  I've seen a disturbing number of personal safety issues (perceived and
otherwise) happening on the T, both posted here as well as anecdotally.  First
of all: please stay safe whatever you do.  Secondly, download the 'MBTA See Say'
App. Please report any untoward incident you see. Action is pretty swift. It is
monitored 24/7.  Please note the following in the app:   1. car number (it'll be
printed at either end of the car, and bus in large text) as well as on the
outside. 2. Train line (orange, red, green, etc) or bus 3. What station you are
at currently  Third: If you're not using the app, noting the date, time, and car
number goes a long way. If you need to report an emergency, dial 911 or call
617-222-1212. You can also send a text message to 617-600-0683.

This map proposes a westward extension of the Blue Line through Cambridge,
Allston, and Watertown, and a northward expansion to Lynn. The Green Line - C
Branch would continue past Govt. Center, run parallel to the orange line through
Community College, and then head east on Rutherford Ave, cross the afford street
bridge, and connect to the SL3 station at Chelsea. Future expansion could see it
continue past SL3 at Eastern Ave. and connect back with the Blue Line near Wood
Island.  Obviously given the economic and political issues facing the T and
public transit in the U.S. at large in the coming years, this is a total
fantasy-- but one can dream.

a zone problem, but despite a ton of searching (including per Rule 7), I can't
find any maps that show how the green lines intersect zones per station. Also,
the Edenred (BU Employee Benefit) account portal through which I buy the card
states;  *Commuter Rail Zone 1A Pass: All Subway lines: Blue, Orange, Green,
Red, and Silver Line*  I found one map that only shows the terminal stations in
a different zone, which is not useful.  If anyone has an answer, or a map

As we get closer to the installation of fare gates at south station &amp; back
bay, I want to give my 2 cents about how the fare gates will benefit riders
&amp; why were better off with them. 1. Everyone feels confident knowing their
fares are being collected.  If everyone is forced to have a valid ticket or
pass, then we all know everybody is paying their fares. In a time where no one
knows what's happening at the federal level, every dollar of fare revenue
counts.   2. Limit bad behavior. I was at south station Saturday night &amp;
unfortunately we were stuck dealing with people riding bikes around the
concourse &amp; outside the building on the platform area. If you dont have a
valid ticket or pass, you wont be as capable of bothering paying customers. In
this case, they got on my train so it wont work all the time, but it  should cut
down that behavior.  3. Promoting reduced fares has a positive impact &amp;
means more people can afford the fare across the system. With the fare
engagement staff providing information about the options for reduced fares, more
people are learning about it &amp; might utilize it, allowing them to pay a fare
they can afford while not having to worry about being called out for fare
evading or missing out on transit options.  According to this streetsblog
article from last November, applications for the low income program have reached
over 13k. Its a safe bet that the numbers have only gone up since. That doesn't
count the other ways riders can qualify for a reduced fare card.
https://mass.streetsblog.org/2024/11/12/its-good-savings-over-13000-riders-are-already-benefiting-from-reduced-fare-charliecards
I hope this will convince you that fare gates are a solution &amp; not a
problem.

Hi all! Mods please feel free to remove if this is too tangential, I figured
this subreddit would be a valid place to post as public transit use is a common
pain point for wheelchair users.  \--  Hi all! I'm part of a group of Boston
University grad students who are working to better understand products that
improve the lives of wheelchair users. Our current goal is to pick a problem
that wheelchair users encounter so we may build a prototype product that offers
a solution to it. We appreciate anyone who is willing to fill out our 5 minute
survey! Thank you!

Title: Why are you bothered by fare evaders?

Before I begin, I pay my fare when riding the T. I believe everyone should pay
their fare if they can.   But there has been a lot of bellyaching on Reddit
about fare evaders. Why does it matter to you if there are people who evade the
fare? It’s the T’s problem, not yours.   The people I see evading the fare tend
to be kids or people of color. As we all know, these people are less likely to
have money and with the costs of everything going up, I can’t fault them for
evading the fare, even if reduced passes are available. A buck ten is still a
lot of money. I’ll leave the T to deal with them, but the amount of pearl
clutching and complaining about fare evaders who are likely not getting in the
way of your day on the T is ridiculous.   Mass transit should honestly be free
for all quite frankly. I bet you the Soviets had free public transit. Isn’t
socialism what a lot of people on Reddit aspire to?

quick preface: I'm a young trans woman who needs a cane to get around because of
chronic hip pain &amp; problems   the entitlement of some people who are sitting
down on the subways is baffling. they look up at me, look down at my cane, and
give me a stink face before going back to their phones. directly acknowledging
and promptly ignoring my visible disability "why don't you speak up then?" I'm a
trans woman who is introverted. i would rather avoid the potential danger of
confrontation. i wouldn't be bothered if people just didn't see it, or didn't

Maybe I'm just stupid so please point out the obvious but having a Chicago El
style loop for the red, orange, and green lines would solve the North/South

would be from south station to state street.  And tbh I would just leave the
blue line alone but let me know your opinion.  Obviously, this will never happen

use CharlieCard on the first car of the train, but it’s not convenient to always
get on the first car especially when it’s crowded…Is there a way to use monthly

Title: Setting the record straight: Providence Line electrification

Author: ToadScoper (ID: t2_ab87r37)
Posted: 2025-08-11 15:17:52 UTC
Post ID: 1mnfslf

Content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is in response to a post I saw earlier today but honestly this topic comes
up so often I’m just gonna make a post. Whenever the topic of Providence Line
electrification comes up, there’s usually a chorus of “the wires are already
there, just buy electric trains!” In reality, upgrading the Providence Line for
regular electric service is one of the most misunderstood MBTA projects. Yes, it
should be electrified, but the barriers are significant, and right now the MBTA
has neither the funding nor the institutional capacity to pursue it. I’ve listed
what I think are the biggest barriers, but there’s probably many more since if
there *were* a clear path to electric service the MBTA *probably* would have
already done it.   1. Amtrak owns the catenary, not the MBTA. The overhead wires
between Boston and Providence are part of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor (NEC)
infrastructure. Amtrak maintains them primarily for intercity service, and while
MBTA can operate under them, it has no say in maintenance schedules, renewal
cycles, or capital improvements. Any MBTA electrification project would require
negotiated agreements with Amtrak, which can be lengthy, expensive, and
politically complex.  2. No FRA-compliant facilities for maintaining electric
trains. Electric locomotives and EMUs require specialized maintenance shops with
high-voltage safety protocols, insulated tooling, and overhead clearance for
live wire work. The MBTA has no FRA-compliant facility set up for electric
motive power. This means either retrofitting existing yards (Readville,
Southampton, Pawtucket, etc.) at great expense, or building entirely new
facilities, which is far from cheap in the Boston metro area (look no further
than what is proposed for Readville and Widett).  3. Many sidings, station
tracks, and storage tracks lack electrification. Even on the NEC itself, dozens
of miles of auxiliary tracks used by MBTA aren’t wired. South Station’s layover
and approach sidings would need electrification. The station tracks south of
Providence, used for layovers and passing moves, also lack catenary. Without
wiring these, MBTA trains couldn’t operate fully electric without major
operational changes.  4. Rolling stock acquisition is a major hurdle. The MBTA
is not in a position to buy electric locomotives or EMUs right now (Fairmount
BEMUs are being handled by Keolis, not the T). Providence Line electrification
would require the largest fleet of electric trains of any MBTA line. Even if the
MBTA purchased ACS-64 locomotives (like Amtrak), its bilevel coach fleet would
need significant electrical modifications to be compatible. That’s a major cost
multiplier.  5. Platform height is the other half of the problem. A major reason
Providence Line service is slower and less reliable than it could be isn’t just
diesel power, it’s the lack of full level boarding at most stations. Converting
every station to high-level platforms (full length ADA-compliant, fully
accessible) would be transformative for dwell times and reliability, even if
service remained diesel. This upgrade alone is a massive, multi-year capital
project.  6. Cost is not pocket change, we’re talking $1B+. A realistic low-end
estimate for electrifying the Providence Line for MBTA service is at least $1
billion in capital upgrades, probably much more once you include new/modified
maintenance facilities, electrification of sidings and layover, rolling stock
procurement, station rebuilds for high-level boarding, and negotiated access and
cost-sharing with Amtrak.  The Providence Line should be electrified, it’s the
MBTA’s best candidate for it, and the NEC wires are indeed already there. But
the reality is that the MBTA is in no fiscal position to pursue the upgrades,
has not indicated any intention to do so, and faces enormous logistical and
technical barriers before a single electric train could run in regular commuter
service.

The piss portal between Park Street and Downtown Crossing is marked in green, as
that transfer is already possible on a single fare.  This post is about walking
transfers on the surface, without having to pay double fare.  Uses of each
transfer (why I think it is worth the cost of adding tap-out gates or surface
Green Line receipt machines to these stations)  **ㆍ**Chestnut Hill Rd -
Cleveland Circle - Reservoir  ⠀⠀Allows for people who live on the surface
sections of the Green Line to get to surface sections of a different branch
easier.  **ㆍ** Brookline Village - Riverway  ⠀Allows for people who live on the
surface sections of the Green Line to get to surface sections of a different
branch easier.  **ㆍ**Fenway - Saint Mary's Street  ⠀Allows for people who live
on the surface sections of the Green Line to get to surface sections of a
different branch easier.  **ㆍ**Symphony - Mass Ave  ⠀Allows people who are on
the Green Line E to get on the faster Orange Line, saving time. Also allows for
redundancy if either the E Branch or Orange Line isn't working properly.
**ㆍ**Copley - Back Bay  ⠀Allows people who are on any branch of the Green Line
to get on the faster Orange Line, saving time. Also allows for redundancy if
either the Green or Orange Line isn't working properly.  **ㆍ**Boylston -
Chinatown  ⠀Allows people who are on any branch of the Green Line to get on the
faster Orange Line, saving time. Also allows for redundancy if either the Green
or Orange Line isn't working properly.  **ㆍ**Downtown Crossing - South Station
⠀Orange Line to this transfer is the fastest way to get from North Station to
South Station if you are a fast walker. Also good for when the Red Line isn't
working properly. (when *is* the Red Line working properly?)  **ㆍ**State -
Downtown Crossing  ⠀Fastest way to do Red - Blue transfer if you are coming
from/going to Ashmont or Braintree.  **ㆍ**Gov't Ctr - Park Street  ⠀Fastest way
to do Red - Blue transfer if you are coming from/going to Alewife.  **ㆍ**Gov't
Ctr - State  ⠀The previous two transfers on this list means the tap-out
infrastructure would be in place for this transfer too, so might as well allow
it. Also allows for redundancy if the Blue Line isn't working properly.    All
of these transfers are already possible, it's just that you have to pay two
fares to utilize them. A tap-out system would remove this problem. It could work
so that as long as you tap in to your next station within 15 minutes of tapping
out of your previous station, the system would allow you to not pay two fares.

With all the focus on the rapid transit system over the last few years, will the
t get more aggressive in the coming years with fixing &amp; upgrading the cr?
Some work has already begun at certain stations, like upgrading natick center
&amp; Winchester. With fifa coming to town next year, i thought a post from
r/transit was fitting. You can find it below.   If we put this much effort into
making Foxboro station better, could we be on the cusp of a systemic change in
how the commuter rail is operated? We could get a new operator if keolis looses
the contract which could mean major improvements. If that happens, we could
focus on getting more riders off the roads &amp; into trains. A post yesterday
made a point to say that if ridership is plateuing, why aren't more people
riding instead of driving as viable alternatives.   Many coments expressed
dissatisfaction with the schedules &amp; frequencies. I agree that's something
that needs improvement. We cant accomplish that without investing in the system.
Its a chicken &amp; egg problem. People want improvements but won't ride the
trains, thus the ridership isnt there to justify said improvements. I hope we
experience more emphasis on the commuter rail in the coming years by offering
realistic, accessible improvements that aren't smoke &amp; mirrors.   R/transit

Title: GL Type 9s skipping requested stops?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is almost a weekly occurrence for me and it always seems to happen on Type
9s. I live one stop after a major street-level stop on the B line (which the
train always stops at regardless of being requested), and I’ll press the button
to request a stop right after we start moving. The “stop requested” light will
come on, the automated voice will say “Approaching X Street”, and yet the train
will just completely speed through the stop, usually stopping at the next one.
While this isn’t a huge deal and I don’t have a problem walking back to my stop,
it’s happened to me enough to where I’m genuinely curious if this is some bug
with the Type 9s. Most of the time the conductor will just say I didn’t press
the request button (I did), although one time I was told I should’ve “pressed it
again” (?????). This has never happened to me on a Type 7 or 8, always on a Type
9. Is this something that happens to you regularly?

Hey Daddy Eng, Long time fan, first time caller. When the updates are made to
Back Bay, could you please add a fare gates to the Clarendon Street entrance or
that side of the main station. This really is such a first world problem but
it’s such a pain to walk all the way to the caboose of the station to go through
the gates, just to walk towards the middle/front of the station back towards the
exit towards Clarendon Street. And quite honestly, I need the extra steps but I
do see some older folks and disabled folks making the same trek and I can
imagine just having some gates on that side would really help those folks.
Anyways not complaining just a ‘helpful suggestion’ I would love to see! - From

maintenance and constant shutdown was needed to bring it up to standard, but it
feels like its just been patchwork half measures that break in a month because
its never been worse. I'm not gonna pretend im a civil engineer that can easily
diagnose this problem but you cannot have a line as important as the red line
just be down this often for worse and worse performance.  my entire life I

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When [According-Manner2770](https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Manner2770/)
posted a fantasy map for the MBTA, it looked like fun. So I spent a couple of
hours playing with [Brand New Subway](https://jpwright.github.io/subway/) to
create some wonderful new service around Boston.  I played under the following
assumptions:  1. I wasn't going to use my capital budget to run subways parallel
to commuter rail. Once you get beyond the urban core, the optimal solution is
frequent regional rail service. (Sorry, the Blue Line isn't going to Lynn or
Salem, but you will be able to make a connection to the subways.) 2. In honor of
Mayor Jeannette A. McCarthy of Waltham, I created a Brown Line Monorail. [She
pitched it at a TedX
Talk](https://patch.com/massachusetts/waltham/mayor-suggests-bringing-monorail-city-waltham-tedx).
The McCarthy Monorail will run along Route 128 and will connect with all
Regional Rail and subway lines. Note that my subways will not extend out beyond
the McCarthy Monorail, with the exception of the Braintree stop on the Red Line,
as the logical connector from the southern end of the Red Line to the McCarthy
Monorail is at Quincy Adams. 3. Needham is outside the McCarthy Monorail
boundary, and Needham is fighting against the MBTA Communities Act, so that
really nice Orange Line extension through Roslindale and West Roxbury will
terminate at Route 128. I replace the trains into Needham Center with a really
nice Bus Rapid Transit route that will connect to the Orange Line terminal and
to the Newton Highlands stop on the Green Line. 4. I was looking to fill
corridors without any rail service, so the Red Line is extended through
Arlington Center and Lexington to connect with the McCarthy Monorail in
Burlington. Twenty years ago the state added a lane to Route 3 without finding a
place for all those cars to go when they reach Burlington. A nice big garage
with easy highway access will fix that problem. 5. Then I started to look at
places that would really benefit from trains but are in a rail wilderness. Blue
Hill Avenue from Mattapan. Columbia Road. Chelsea. Medford Square. Watertown.
And the holy grail, the terminals at Logan Airport. So I pulled out a teal
crayon and started at Route 128 in Westwood (and the beloved McCarthy Monorail),
and ran the line up the Northeast Corridor to Hyde Park, then diverted to
Mattapan. I ran the line up Blue Hill and Columbia Road, through the heart of
South Boston, and on to Logan. Then the crayon wanted to head through Wellington
to Medford Square, Alewife, and on to Watertown. From there, I did bring it
through Waltham and parallel to the Regional Rail to meet the McCarthy Monorail,
because Jeannette should have a really good connection to her monorail. I
doubled the frequency of service on the Teal Line between Watertown Square and
Mattapan, and marked that part of the route in yellow. 6. Other notes. I
extended the Green Line from Medford/Tufts to Mystic Valley Parkway and a
connection to the Teal Line. I extended the Orange Line across the line to
Wyoming Avenue in Melrose, because I thought it would be fun to have a transit
line that goes to Wyoming. I included the Red-Blue connector at Charles-MGH, and
restored Green Line service between Heath Street and Forest Hills. Red Line
trains from Braintree will terminate at Arlington Heights, Ashmont trains will
make the trip out to Burlington.  It was fun. Sadly, I now must return to
reality and the crappy bus service that is now running where there should be
trains.

My brother gifted me his charliecard since he doesn’t work in the city anymore;
it still has about $50 on it. I use a reduced fare card and was wondering if
anyone knows if they can transfer the funds to my card at the Charlie Service
Center? Planning on heading over there next week but figured I’d ask here if
it’s possible and maybe save myself the trip if it’s not! 💚  UPDATE: they did it
no problem! :-)

Title: If fares were rounded up to the next dollar, could that help with the massive debt?

I am likely having an “ELI5” moment but:  Why can’t fares be rounded to the next
dollar to try and create revenue?  It’s a small increase for riders but
collectively could decrease debt for the T?   Ridership levels are steadily
rising and although not back to pre-pandemic levels, they are getting closer
each month. Could a simple idea of rounding up be of use or is the debt problem
too far gone??

RL train packed with marchers leaving downtown. Good energy and lots of older
people riding. Young woman comes on and immediately fires up a crack pipe with
almost nonexistent attempt to conceal.   I lean down eye level  and say “you
can’t smoke crack on this track , it’s upsetting to people. Get off on the next
stop and you can smoke outside of the car. Thank you.” She takes a hit, puts it
away and gets off with me at Porter. No conflict, no tension.  I’ve been riding
the T for 40+ years and you always have to assess whether or not to get involved
and a lot of factors and nuance. I’ve also been a social worker for a long time
so generally feel comfortable with a calm approach that is humane but direct.
I’m not advocating or preaching that people say something but given that we seem
to have an increase in blatant smoking on trains, thought I’d share a minor
success. I do feel that sense that a train car is collectively respected and one
person creating a problem isn’t going to go unaddressed by me if it feels safe
enough to intervene.

Around 10:25 AM today I got off the orange line, headed northbound to Oak Grove,
at Wellington Station. I was focused on finding my friend who was picking me up.
So, I got to the top of the escalator, and, halfway through the skywalk bridge I
suddenly  realized something wasn't right. My old, worn, sage green Adidas
backpack was gone! I retraced all my steps. I asked the employees, strangers,
tourists, people's dogs....everyone...'have you seen my backpack?' No one did,
of course. So I called the MBTA's lost and found #, and when I called they said
they couldn't deal with lost items right now because the orange line was having
signal problems. (What one has to do with the other....I have no clue!).  I
think I absent-mindedly left it on the train (one with "all new orange line
cars" northbound to Oak Grove, got off at wellington at around 10:25am), or on
the center platform at Wellington. Usually things that get left behind in public
get scooped up, one way or another. The only thing I can't replace is my
medications. I've had this happen before. At least all my money and all my cards
were in my pocket. I also had a locked galaxy phone that's like 5 years old in
there, notebooks, tax documents, a black hoodie, pens, crochet hooks, some
tools, and an umbrella. No cash or credit cards.   If someone finds it with my
stuff still in it, I'll give you a reward. I have a seizure disorder and need my
medications. I can't get any of them replaced (because I've already had lost
meds replaced several times. Im a total lummox!   I really appreciate people's
kindness, and I think it's wonderful when someone is willing to unselfishly help
out a stranger. I would be so grateful if someone found it! I think most people
are pretty decent and would do the right thing, but who knows?  Any suggestions
as to what I could do about this? I figured I have nothing left to lose, so why
not post on reddit? Any advice/information would be much appreciated! Thank you
everyone! 😊

Sullivan Square is a busy stop. Dozens of busses and the Orange Line pass by at
all times. Birds have amazing eyesight and can perceive colors we can't even
imagine. They have no problems finding food, but they do have problems with
bowel control. If you feed a bird something that's not part of its diet, not
only do you put the bird in danger, but make them associate Sullivan with easy
food access, meaning they will build their nests there and congregate where we
all wait for the bus. This means that they will fly inches away from us and crap
EVERYWHERE. I saw a literal mountain of bird poop. Not a splatter, not a stain,
but an actual PILE. Pigeons are the rats of the bird world and it absolutely
baffles me that people are feeding chip crumbs, Dunkin crumbs, popcorn, etc. I
even saw a bird eating cigarette ash.   TL;DR: Read the signs, don't feed the
pigeons. Their brains are solely wired for finding food, building a nest,
pooping willy nilly, and making more pigeons.

Title: Copley Bus lane is a complete own goal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The city of Boston destroyed a bus lane this past week, taking it out of
commission less than one year after it was installed. Mayor Wu explained her
reasoning in a letter to the Back Bay Association, and it makes no sense.
*“Based on observational analysis reinforcing community feedback following the
permanent installation in July 2024, the dedicated bus lane has not functioned
as intended to justify the space allocation. In addition to buses often not
having a clear path of travel, the bus lane is regularly used for driving and
parking on parts of the street that are very constrained serving area
businesses, hotels, and the Boston Public Library.”*  After supposedly poor
performance, the bus lane is being removed because it takes up too much space.
But what has its performance been? Well, according to [Transit
Matters ](https://transitmatters.org/blog/media-statement-calls-upon-the-city-of-boston-to-pause-boylston-street-bus-lane-removal)the
lane has seen 40% reductions in travel times during rush hour in the most
heavily trafficked segments of the route.  That seems pretty good to
[me](https://chasetoday.substack.com/), Mayor Wu seemingly thinks otherwise, but
that’s only a difference of opinion. What is really galling is that she follows
this up by claiming the lane has to go because drivers keep breaking the rules
and undermining the point of the separated lane. A bus lane, designed to
separate transit riders from commuter traffic, was determined to be
underperforming **and** hamstrung by rule breakers… so we are just scrapping the
whole thing? That seems pretty backwards. If mayor really wanted the lane to
justify its space, then she would get those damn cars out of the bus lane!
That’s the whole game with a separated lane, its separated!  The city actually
has a real answer for this and blowing up the lane so close to its
implementation makes zero sense. Traffic enforcement cameras on buses are all
the rage these days. Manual enforcement of traffic violations is completely
impractical. You would need a cop or parking enforcement officer on every curb
in the city! It would be madness. But drafting laws to order the street, not
enforcing them, and then throwing up your hands when people don't follow them is
madness too. Traffic cameras solve this problem. Getting double parkers and
traffic cheats out of the way speeds up commutes for everyone, not just buses.
New York has recently had great success with this policy and has seen an almost
complete drop off in repeat offenders.  Massachusetts legalized these cameras
last December, but like everything in this State, implementation of this common
sense idea has been hamstrung by bureaucracy so they aren’t actually operational
yet. But they have never been closer to reality than they are now, and they
solve the exact problem Wu acknowledges.  Why the hell this lane was scrapped
isn’t hard to explain, Mayor Wu would rather sell out to the Back Bay
Association and the wealthiest residents of the city than provide meaningful
improvements to working class Bostonian commuters. This undermines her support
for low income residents, her vision of Boston never backing down, and progress
we have been making on a greener city. Its a complete own goal for no reason
With the Federal Government throwing up on itself under the command of Donald
Trump, I would hoped that Democrats could offer a real counter example. “See,
Republicans don’t know how to govern! Not like us here in Boston, where housing
is expensive, traffic is shit, and we are actively undoing our work to improve
it.” But this seems to be the best we can do

 * The attendees tonight had a significantly more "NIMBY" character than the
previous meeting. To some of the people present it doesn't matter if the
construction is safe, it just shouldn't happen at all. * A common theme was to
make it Arlington's problem instead.  * One attendee insisting on a vast
conspiracy from elected officials to hide this project from the people of
Cambridge for years, despite the meeting 6 months ago and its inclusion in the
CIP more than a year ago now.  * Asbestos asbestos asbestos, that's what the
talk was about for the most part.  * The MBTA stated that they are now reviewing
tenting/venting as an option compared to misting with external consultants. They
state they have not come to a determination on if it is feasible, or if it
provides a benefit compared to misting. * They also stated that the contractor
has some amount of input on this decision, the exact level there was not really
clarified. * Some people with ears actually realized that they are in fact
determining the best course of action to follow, not spraying asbestos at kids
blindly. Shocking. * The meeting was not long enough. There were a lot of good
questions that they didn't have time for in a single hour. * Combining the
project with the garage redevelopment was also brought up again multiple times,
it doesn't really work with the projected timeline for the garage, and the
tunnel location would inhibit use of the tail tracks for train storage. * While
they weren't discussing asbestos, we got some nice renders and a detailed
diagram showing that the portal will be on Station Access Rd. I don't think this
site has any legitimate noise concerns.

Basically titled. I used the emergency button multiple times and spoke to three
separate people. Two of them told me that someone was there actively working on
the elevator which turned out to not be true. Also this elevator seemed
relatively new idk why it stopped randomly  My phone had zero service, I
couldn't reach anyone at all including 911. I tried calling from the phone of
the other girls in the elevator but it wasn't working. I assumed they also had
no service. It wasn't until three hours later they told me they could reach 911
on one of their phones. That's when the fire rescue eventually came and they
told us no one had contacted them and no one was working on the elevator.  I am
extremely exhausted from this right now with a migraine and I feel like throwing
a fit. Who do I complain to? What can I do? It's an extreme problem when the
emergency line people lie to us about someone being there and don't bother
calling 911 as part of their protocol. I also lowkey want free T rides from this
lmao but yeah I am super stressed right now from this.  Edit: Since so many
people are asking lol. This was the elevator at Kendall Square outbound

# Introduction: A New Vision for Boston’s Rail Network  Boston’s existing
transit system consists of separate subway lines (Red, Orange, Blue) and
commuter rail lines that converge on South Station or North Station. As a
result, these two major rail terminals operate like dead ends: trains must
terminate and reverse direction, causing congestion, longer travel times, and
inconvenient transfers. Inspired by European RER (e.g. Paris) and German S-Bahn
models, as well as the Japanese practice of “through-running” between subways
and suburban railways (e.g. Tokyo, Osaka), this plan envisions integrating
commuter rail with the urban subway system.  Rather than building a single
North-South Rail Link tunnel under downtown, we propose using Boston’s **three
subway lines**—Blue, Orange, and Red—as the primary corridors through the city
center. By extending or creating short connector tracks on both ends of each
subway line, we can allow commuter rail lines to run straight through the urban
core. This approach drastically reduces transfers, relieves congestion at
downtown rail terminals, and establishes a unified “regional express” network.
In addition, we propose upgrading the **Grand Junction Railway (GJR)**—an
existing freight and equipment corridor in Cambridge and Allston—to provide an
alternative cross-city path outside the congested downtown arteries.
Ultimately, the goal is to create **three major through-running axes**:  1.
**Blue Line Axis**: Linking the north shore’s Newburyport/Rockport Line with the
west corridor (Worcester/Framingham). 2. **Orange Line Axis**: Linking the
northern Haverhill/Lowell corridors with the southern Providence/Stoughton and
Franklin/Foxboro lines. 3. **Red Line Axis**: Linking the northwest Fitchburg
corridor with the southeastern Old Colony lines.  Below, we detail how each
subway line is extended or connected to commuter rail, the upgrades required,
and how we will phase in these changes.  # 1. Blue Line Through-Running  #
Northern Extension and Connection  Currently, the Blue Line ends at Wonderland
(in Revere). We propose **extending** it northward to Lynn and constructing a
short connector near Wonderland to tie into the **Newburyport/Rockport commuter
lines**. That way, trains from Rockport or Newburyport could either continue to
North Station as usual, or run straight onto the Blue Line tracks for direct
service into East Boston and downtown.  * **Lynn Terminus**: The Blue Line
itself would run to Lynn as its normal subway endpoint, with high-frequency
local service. * **Wonderland Connector**: Some trains from the
Rockport/Newburyport lines could join the Blue Line near Wonderland, allowing
them to travel into downtown through the existing Blue Line tunnel.  # Southern
Extension and Grand Junction  On the downtown side, we want the Blue Line to
continue beyond Bowdoin or Government Center toward Kendall Square. This is
similar to prior “Red-Blue Connector” concepts, but extends further to connect
with the **Grand Junction Railway (GJR)** near MIT. The GJR, once fully
upgraded, would allow trains to cross the Charles River into Allston and join
the **Worcester/Framingham line**. As a result, those commuter trains could pass
through Cambridge on GJR, switch onto the Blue Line tunnel at Kendall, and
emerge on the north side near Wonderland or Lynn, giving a direct route across
the metropolitan area.  # Operations and Turnbacks  * **City Core Frequency**:
The Lynn–Kendall segment (the Blue Line “core”) can run at intervals of around
5–6 minutes during peak periods. * **Suburban Extensions**: On the
Rockport/Newburyport side, certain long-haul trains might run all the way from
Beverly or Salem through to Worcester; in reality, many trains would short-turn
at Salem or Lynn. * **West Side**: On the Worcester/Framingham side, not all
trains would go downtown via the GJR/Blue Line; some would still end at South
Station. The ones that do through-run would merge onto the Blue Line near
Kendall, run through downtown, and proceed north to Wonderland or Lynn.  In
practice, having a portion of Worcester or Framingham trains follow this path
reduces congestion at South Station and gives riders an alternative route
through Cambridge. Lynn and possibly Framingham would have facilities to
short-turn certain trains or store them when not in service.  # 2. Orange Line
Through-Running  # Northern Connections  The Orange Line currently runs from
Forest Hills in the south through downtown to Oak Grove in the north. Under this
plan:  1. **Haverhill Connection**: Between Community College station and
Sullivan Square, we build a link to the Haverhill commuter line. At that point,
Haverhill trains could enter the Orange Line right-of-way to continue south
through the Orange Line tunnel. 2. **Lowell Connection**: The plan also calls
for a short spur departing the Orange Line near Community College/Sullivan to
connect with the Lowell commuter line. A new “Inner Belt” station would be
created on this spur. As a result, the northern end of the Orange Line could fan
out into two branches: one continuing to Oak Grove (and onward to Haverhill),
and another heading to Lowell via Inner Belt.  # Southern Connections  At the
southern end:  1. **Needham Line Merger**: The short Needham commuter line would
be converted to “Orange Line standards” (full electrification, high platforms,
grade separation) and effectively absorbed into the Orange Line south of Forest
Hills. 2. **Providence/Stoughton + Franklin/Foxboro**: With the addition of a
short connector track (likely near Readville or Hyde Park), trains from the
Providence/Stoughton or Franklin/Foxboro lines could also join the Orange Line.
This allows riders from those lines to travel straight into the city on the
Orange Line corridor.  # Operations and Turnbacks  Because the Orange Line would
handle multiple northern branches (Haverhill, Lowell) and multiple southern
branches (Needham, Providence/Foxboro), the core downtown segment (Oak
Grove–Forest Hills) would see trains arriving from four directions. During peak
hours, you might see frequencies in the range of 3–4 minutes in the trunk. Each
suburban branch might get intervals of 10–15 minutes, partly by short-turning or
skipping certain sections. For instance:  * Some trains on the northern side end
at Oak Grove; others continue onto Haverhill or Lowell. * Some trains on the
southern side end at Forest Hills; others continue onto Needham, Providence, or
Franklin.  High-platform conversions along Haverhill, Lowell, Needham, and other
commuter lines would be needed, as would electrification. Freight usage, where
it exists, would either be re-routed or time-separated.  # 3. Red Line
Through-Running  # Northern Extension  The Red Line ends at Alewife, but we
propose extending it along the old Lexington Branch corridor through Arlington
and Lexington to **Bedford**, near the I-95 highway. This corridor was once
studied in the 1970s but never built. At the same time, near Alewife or Porter
Square, we would build a **connector** linking the Red Line tracks to the
**Fitchburg commuter line** (which usually runs from North Station through
Waltham, Concord, and Fitchburg).  With that connection, trains from Fitchburg
could merge onto the Red Line tunnel near Alewife, run through central Boston
(Harvard, Park Street, Downtown Crossing), and continue south as Red Line
trains—thus bypassing North Station entirely.  # Southern Connection  On the
south side, the Red Line has two branches: Braintree and Ashmont. We propose a
short connector near JFK/UMass or Braintree that links the **Old Colony lines**
(Greenbush, Kingston/Plymouth, Middleborough) into the Red Line. This would
allow certain commuter trains from the South Shore to skip South Station and
instead ride the Red Line corridor straight downtown.  Some Old Colony trains
would still go to South Station, especially from stations beyond I-95 or I-495,
but a portion would join the Red Line for direct service. Meanwhile, the Ashmont
branch could stay as a local subway branch, or in the long run we could link it
to the Fairmount corridor, depending on future planning.  # Operations and
Turnbacks  * **In the core** (e.g., Alewife–JFK-UMass), the Red Line already
runs at high frequency, sometimes 3–4 minutes at peak. Through-running would
require scheduling suburban trains within these slots. We could designate
“express/limited-stop” trains so that the downtown trunk doesn’t become overly
congested. * **Far Suburbs**: Fitchburg is quite long, so half the trains might
only go as far as Waltham or Concord. On the south side, Braintree remains an
important hub: some trains terminate there, some continue on to Plymouth or
Middleborough. * **Ashmont** would largely serve local Red Line frequencies,
possibly unaffected by the new commuter spurs. Over time, we could integrate it
further if desired.  # 4. Grand Junction Railway (GJR) as a Key Link  Currently,
the GJR is a mostly single-track rail corridor crossing Cambridge and Allston,
used largely for freight or non-revenue transfers. By fully **double-tracking
and electrifying** the GJR, and removing freight operations, we can transform it
into a second cross-city path. For instance:  * **Worcester–North Link**: A
train from Worcester could avoid South Station by jumping onto GJR at Allston
(West Station) and then continuing across the Charles near MIT and onward to
North Station or Haverhill. * **Blue Line Connection**: Meanwhile, the Blue Line
southern extension can meet GJR near Kendall Square, offering a downtown tunnel
route for Worcester/Framingham trains. * **Eliminating Freight**: Because GJR
would see frequent passenger traffic, we would end freight usage or reroute it
to other lines, building fences and grade separations along the corridor in
Cambridge.  Upgrading the GJR to passenger-rail standards means building new
stations (MIT, Cambridgeport, etc.), possibly bridging or tunneling to remove
road crossings, and ensuring the line can support 10–15 minute headways in peak
hours.  # 5. Required Infrastructure Upgrades  Below is a concise overview of
what we must do across the network to make these through-running corridors
function smoothly:  1. **Electrification (Dual-Mode)**    * Subway tunnels use
750 V DC via a third rail, while commuter lines typically prefer 25 kV AC
overhead wires for efficiency and speed. We plan to adopt both, so that trains
can automatically switch between overhead power outside the city and third-rail
power in the subway sections. 2. **New Rolling Stock**    * We need modern EMUs
(Electric Multiple Units) that can handle both third rail and overhead systems,
and that fit the profiles of both the subway tunnels and commuter rail lines.
Such dual-power vehicles already exist in other North American systems. 3.
**Platform Reconstruction**    * Subway lines use high-level platforms for
step-free boarding. Many MBTA commuter stations have low platforms. For a single
fleet to serve both, commuter rail stations on the routes designated for
through-running must be retrofitted with **uniform high platforms**. This
ensures level boarding and faster dwell times. 4. **Track Expansion and Grade
Separation**    * Several commuter lines are still single-track or have only
partial double track, so we must add second tracks or build passing sidings to
support higher frequency.    * We must eliminate or bridge over road crossings
to avoid safety risks and slowdowns, especially where trains will run
frequently.    * Certain route junctions, such as Bay Junction near JFK/UMass or
near Forest Hills, require new flyovers to separate crossing movements. 5.
**Signaling and Control**    * Busy urban rail corridors rely on advanced
control systems like CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control) to allow safe
operation at minimal headways (2–3 minutes). The entire through-running network,
including commuter branches, must integrate with a single dispatch center. 6.
**Park-and-Ride and Transfer Hubs**    * We propose large parking facilities at
stations near I-95 or I-495, where drivers can switch to commuter rail, reducing
highway congestion.    * Key transfer stations—like Kendall (Blue/Red), Forest
Hills (Orange + multiple commuter lines), Alewife (Red + Fitchburg
connection)—will get improved circulation, signage, and universal design
features. 7. **Seaport Coverage**    * By adapting the “Track 61” corridor and
adding a short link at Widett Circle, we can run some trains directly into the
Seaport (e.g., from the Fairmount or Franklin lines). This would open up a
crucial new transit corridor to Boston’s booming waterfront district.  # 6.
Implementation Timeline  Because the plan is ambitious and expensive, it will
unfold in stages:  1. **Phase 1 (1–3 years)**:    * Detailed planning,
feasibility studies, environmental reviews, public outreach.    * Preliminary
engineering for key connectors (Needham into Orange, Blue–Lynn extension,
Red–Blue connector to Kendall, etc.). 2. **Phase 2 (4–8 years)**:    * Begin
**pilot project**: for example, incorporate the Needham Line into the Orange
Line. Temporarily close the Needham commuter branch to rebuild it with
electrification and high platforms.    * Build the connector near Forest Hills.
Acquire a small fleet of dual-mode EMUs. Open “Orange + Needham” as a
demonstration of how city-suburban direct service works.    * Simultaneously
start constructing the Blue Line extension to Lynn. 3. **Phase 3 (9–15 years)**:
* Expand the network by upgrading more lines (e.g., Haverhill, Fitchburg, Old
Colony).    * Complete the Red Line extension to Bedford, plus the Fitchburg
connector near Alewife.    * Upgrade Grand Junction to double-track, electrify
it, and build West Station. Start partial through-service from Worcester to
North Station or Blue Line.    * By the end of Phase 3, each subway line might
have at least one “through route” open. 4. **Phase 4 (16–25 years)**:    *
Finish connecting the Old Colony lines to the Red Line, the Franklin/Providence
lines to the Orange, and the final links for the Blue.    * Install final
missing station improvements, finalize the Seaport coverage with Track 61.    *
Integrate the entire system under a new fare and scheduling framework, so that
commuter rail, through trains, and subway lines are effectively a single
regional system.  Throughout each phase, newly completed segments will yield
immediate benefits—higher frequencies, easier transfers, or direct
suburban-to-city trains. These benefits build momentum and public acceptance,
supporting continued investment. After roughly two decades, Boston would have a
unified rail network where trains from Salem, Lynn, or Beverly can directly run
to Newton or Worcester; riders from Haverhill or Lowell can reach Needham or
Foxboro in one seat; and Fitchburg passengers can travel to Plymouth without
changing trains.  # 7. Conclusion  By extending and adapting the existing MBTA
subway lines—Blue, Orange, and Red—to serve as cross-city trunk corridors for
commuter rail, Boston can solve the long-standing problem of dead-end commuter
rail terminals at North Station and South Station. Instead of investing in a
single large tunnel, we leverage multiple smaller connectors, the Grand Junction
Railway, and modern dual-mode EMU technology to create **a fully integrated
“city-suburban” rail system**.  This approach draws on successful models in
Tokyo and Paris, where suburban trains share tunnels with urban rapid transit,
providing seamless end-to-end journeys. While the operational and engineering
challenges—such as converting lines to high platforms, electrifying them, and
installing advanced signals—are significant, they are entirely feasible with
current technology. The result would be a dramatic improvement in regional
mobility, reduced traffic congestion, and a more accessible, sustainable
metropolitan area.  In time, Boston would move beyond the limitations of
separate subway and commuter rail networks. Commuters would enjoy frequent,
direct rides from suburban stations through the urban core, and overall
ridership would increase as public transit becomes more convenient and reliable.
This plan envisions a 20-year roadmap that fundamentally reshapes how the region
travels, paving the way for the next era of vibrant, coordinated public
transportation in Greater Boston.

I pay $90 a month auto pay for my Charlie Card. I was told it is linked to my
Link Pass. Sometimes I take a week-long or a month-long vacation, I still pay.
What pissed me off is that I cannot find out how much money I have left in my
account. I want to know how much I have used each month, how much I have left on
the account. I cannot check online. I cannot check at a station. Asking an agent
at the station does not help. Calling MBTA is also useless. Nobody seems to
know. They told me that the money is carried over to the next month. Sure? But
how much? The data has to be somewhere in the system.  To make is worse, I was
told that if I pause the auto pay, I can not use the card. Why such policy? I am
confused. It looks like MBTA has a lot of improvements to make.   Does anybody
have this problem? What do you do?

and [Transportation for Massachusetts](https://t4ma.org) released a report last
month on transportation funding:
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVfwtrvoQnMIS68Z11jyrGnw5kJBxx34/view?emci=1aef419d-87d2-ef11-88d0-0022482a9d92&amp;emdi=deffe77d-f4d4-ef11-88d0-0022482a9d92&amp;ceid=19257582](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVfwtrvoQnMIS68Z11jyrGnw5kJBxx34/view?emci=1aef419d-87d2-ef11-88d0-0022482a9d92&amp;emdi=deffe77d-f4d4-ef11-88d0-0022482a9d92&amp;ceid=19257582)
"This report is designed to be a roadmap for the Governor and legislature to
build the strongest and most equitable transportation funding package in the
country – and make the transportation system the people of Massachusetts need
and deserve a reality."  To briefly summarize:  # Guiding Principles: What the
People of Massachusetts Really Want  * Equity * Accessibility * Safety *
Affordability * Choice * Environmental Responsibility  * Improved Public Health
# The Misconceptions that are Holding us Back  * Question 1: Why does it seem
like the MBTA has plenty of money, but is unable to spend it wisely?    * **The
MBTA and all transit systems in Massachusetts have been chronically underfunded
for decades.**       * The MBTA needs new, dedicated, consistent, and
diversified revenue streams that will appropriately fund the MBTA in the long
term.       * The MBTA has proven that it is capable of spending money
responsibly and appropriately, especially within the last 12 months.       *
Underinvesting in the short term will almost certainly cost significantly more
in the long run. * Question 2: Does the gas tax cover the costs of roads and
bridges?    * **The gas tax and other fees associated with driving only cover a
small portion of roadway costs.**       * Given the State’s climate goals, the
Commonwealth should anticipate that the gas tax will decline and disappear
entirely in the coming decades.       * The gas tax has never fully funded our
state’s roadway transportation needs. * Question 3: Do fares cover the cost of
transit?    * **Fares only cover a small portion of transit operations.
Historically, increasing fares in Massachusetts has depressed ridership and has
not meaningfully filled budget gaps.**       * Fares are an unstable and
declining revenue source.       * Increasing fares would depress ridership,
which is even more of a concern at a time when increasing transit ridership is a
statewide goal.       * Increasing fares has not historically improved service
or meaningfully closed budget gaps. * Question 4: Can Electric Vehicles alone
meet the Commonwealth’s transportation emission reduction goals?    * **Electric
Vehicles (“EVs”) are an important piece of our strategy to reduce Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) emissions, but we need to broaden the overall decarbonization approach
with a greater focus on expanding transit access.**       * Electric Vehicles
should be part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions, however; EVs
alone cannot solve other transportation problems like congestion and road
safety. Investments in transit, safer streets, and active transportation are
essential tools for solving these problems.       * Thoughtful incentives can
ensure EVs help all communities, especially those historically impacted by
pollution and high transportation costs, while actually removing gasoline
vehicles from the road. * Question 5: Are Public Private Partnerships a
sure-fire way to reduce costs for government agencies?    * **Public Private
Partnerships are not always cost-saving mechanisms and should be subject to
careful review.**       * Transportation authorities should consider where
contracting with private entities makes most sense, and to hold those
contractors accountable, but should not treat privatization through new P3s as a
strategy for reducing revenue needs.       * To maximize public benefit, and
safeguard against P3 pitfalls, we must make sure that transit agencies have the
institutional capacity to navigate the complex transactions of P3s. Agencies
should be equipped to effectively manage P3s from start to finish.       *
Massachusetts should set clearer legislative authority and parameters for P3s to
ensure that worker rights are protected and that government entities are
protected when projects are over budget, and under performing. * Question 6:
Isn’t the Fair Share Amendment going to fill the funding gaps for transportation
and education?    * **The Fair Share amendment is successfully generating new
revenue for education and transportation, but is not enough revenue to fill
revenue gaps for both.** (especially relevant given Healey's approach relying
exclusively upon it)       * Voters support increased investments in
transportation and education.       * Additional transportation funding sources
are needed, regardless of the precise division of Fair Share funds with
education.       * Transportation revenue can come from non-transportation
sources.       * Transportation funding can be raised in ways that reduce rather
than worsen inequality.  # Framework for an Equitable and Sustainable
Transportation Funding Package  * **Recommendation 1: Focus on more equitable
and sustainable revenue options first.**    * New corporate minimum tax tiers.
* Eliminating special exemptions, deductions or credits that reduce the value of
taxes on personal income or corporate profits. (Healey has been doing the
opposite since she entered office) * **Recommendation 2: Ensure low and moderate
income individuals are not overburdened with paying for the transportation
system.**    * When considering a user fee, the legislature should ask the
following:       * Does the user fee help change a behavior and/or make progress
toward a mobility, climate or public health goal? If not, then this user fee
should be off the table.       * What is the potential for disproportionate
impact on low income individuals?       * If there is a disproportionate impact,
are mitigation measures possible and reasonable to implement? * **Recommendation
3: Include policies and revenue options that allow for local and regional self
determination.**    * Regional Ballot Initiatives (RBIs)    * Transit-Oriented
Development Value Capture * **Recommendation 4: Include smart policies that will
shape a more sustainable transportation future.**    * Setting a Vehicle Miles
Traveled (VMT) reduction goal for 2050.    * Creating a plan to reduce reliance
on the gas tax and transit fares by 2050 and 2030 respectively.    * Provide
adequate resources to electrify transit statewide.  # Conclusion  Now is the
time to act on equitable and sustainable solutions to Massachusetts’
transportation funding challenges. We urge policymakers to recommit to this
work, using a framework informed by equity best practices, lessons from other
states, and, most importantly, the voices of people in communities around the
Commonwealth.   Meeting this moment means confronting long-held misperceptions
about transportation financing, exploring a variety of known and new revenue
options, and leaving behind ideas that no longer fit with our state’s long-term
vision.   The organizations involved in crafting this report look forward to
being partners in taking on these challenges together, to bring to life the
transportation system people in the Commonwealth deserve.

  Commuter rail is notoriously finicky. It starts off well and becomes
unreliable in a year or two when the novelty wears off and everyone realizes how
much of a pain it is. Developers love it because they can play the cash grab
game with the state government and put up a bunch of cheaply slapped together
Soviet style "luxury" apartment buildings with the obligatory scrap "affordable
housing" units you need to win the Hunger Games to get into. Property values may
increase in the short term but putting an end of line commuter station in an
economicly depressed area could cause problems in the long term.   It's
difficult to see who the SCCR benefits besides landlords, developers,
politicians, and the companies contracted to build the rail itself. A lot of
people in Fall River and New Bedford will be priced out of the areas they grew
up in for a train to nowhere. Fall River is a long way from Boston. Where will
these people be commuting to? Nobody really knows until the thing is up and
running. Why didn't the MBTA focus on fixing its core service before expanding?
It looks to me like a few people are getting rich off thing and a few more stand
to become richer. The unreliable nature of MBTA commuter rail ensures ridership
will decrease after the novelty wears off. Rents will not. People will become
displaced. State mandated fake affordable housing will pop up around the areas
that will look outdated as soon as they go up and will offer nothing for your
average worker. It will only make life a little harder and more expensive for
everyone but the few who won a dystopian lottery, a few yuppies, some shady
developers and their politician friends. You can say goodbye to any character
those neighborhoods used to have as well.

This note is really for Phil Eng, who I hope reads this subreddit. I realize
that tap-to-pay is a work in progress. I do have a few comments that might help
going forward:  1. My wife and I both have reduced-fare senior CharlieCards. I
signed up for tap-to-pay with my phone, but my wife cannot, as we share a credit
card. Apparently (and I sort of understand why) reduced fare tap-to-pay cards
can be associated with only one account. This is a problem for us, and we
certainly won't be the only ones.  2. My reduced fare Charlie Card recently
expired. I was happy to see that I could renew it online. However, the balance
on my old card was not transferred, and I had to go downtown to transfer it.
That kind of makes the online renewal pretty useless since you have to go
downtown anyway.  3. Why can't the T's tap-to-pay work like NYC? We were
recently down there, and you just tap your phone - no signup, no complicated
system, it just works. I realize that this won't work for reduced fares, but
most people pay full fare.  You and your team are making great progress, keep it
up! I live on the C line, and service is noticeably improved.

Title: Where and When is the Commuter Rail Faster

Author: Axel_Wench (ID: t2_kgitfzc)
Posted: 2024-11-05 21:19:55 UTC
Post ID: 1gkhntn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier this year WGBH tested whether the Commuter Rail or driving was faster
from Worcester. Unsurprisingly the car was faster, however it got me wondering
what stations are faster, and most importantly the experiment took place pretty
early in the morning, so what stations are faster during rush hour? I crunched
the numbers myself and here’s what I came up with using Google Maps to estimate
Station-to-Station travel times when set to arrive at 6:50AM and 8:50AM. I also
estimated how a “Modernized” Commuter Rail would compare, based on reports by
the advocacy group TransitMatters. A link to the calculations is attached below,
I’m sure I’ve made some errors in there. I’ll talk more about the methodology
below.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBdvZDAJovlqxdlYQaI5l3waPZOiO9Yl/edit?usp=drive_link&amp;ouid=102473295830839494867&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true
Note: “Local” and “Express” don’t need to be literal, simply different service
patterns with significant time savings. Super Express does refer to the
Worcester-Framingham-Boston Landing express service.    More details and other
thoughts:  Commuter Rail Travel Time: This was taken from the schedule,
primarily over the summer on weekdays. Instead of just taking the most relevant
scheduled train (closest arrival time to 6:50/8:50) I wanted to look
holistically and averaged together travel times within a few minutes or
identified faster alternate service patterns and assessed those differently. If
there was a split, like 54m, 50m, 42m, 38m the first two would be averaged as
one service pattern, and the latter two as another, with both being reported on
the map if relevant.   Driving Travel Times: I have driven very little in Boston
and especially the suburbs so I have no frame of reference as to whether
Google’s estimates are realistic, if you have experience with these trips let me
know! Google provided a range and I took the mean, although its possible that
the typical driving time is skewed toward one end of that range instead. This
data was collected throughout several weekdays during the summer.  Modernized
Commuter Rail: The advocacy group TransitMatters has released reports on
modernizing the Commuter Rail over the past few years that feature
electrification, level-boarding, and some track improvements to decrease travel
times. I’ve taken their proposed travel times and calculated the percent
decrease (based on the current travel times they list in the reports) for the
termini and applied that to the entire relevant branch. For the Needham branch I
applied the time savings from the Fairmount Line. This approach is overly
simplified and probably overstates the benefits. Additionally, TransitMatters’s
reports are probably on the optimistic end for what we might really see.  The
Last Mile Problem: Most people don’t live at a Commuter Rail station and work at
North/South Station, and they tend to include some buffer, so they don’t miss
the train, but since every scenario is different I think using
Station-to-Station travel times is a sensible baseline. The 15-minute faster
benchmark was arbitrary, but accounts for this idea somewhat.

I need to get to North Station from Oak Grove tomorrow and Friday.   I can time
my trips with the Haverhill CR line no problem.  Question is, how do I handle
those damn fare gates at North Station?  Getting out I imagine I can just have a
Keolis rep let me out.. but how about getting back in?  I take CR trains South
all the time (Back Bay) but never boarded one at North Station since the new
gates.  How does this work with the OL shutdown?

* Regular Red Line speed across the system has increased from 16.3 MPH on the
week of August 26th to 18.8 so far on Monday.  * Median travel time between
Braintree to JFK/UMass (northbound) has decreased from 33 minutes on September
3rd to 21 minutes on Monday.   * Point made by WBUR about the median travel time
on northbound service: It was actually even faster — around 17 minutes — until
signal problems struck and caused delays in the afternoon.  * Median travel time
between JFK/UMass and Braintree (southbound) decreased from 32 minutes on
September 5th to 20 minutes on Monday.  * The average speed of trains between
Braintree and JFK/UMass (northbound) increased from 15.29 MPH on September 5th
to 24.62 MPH on Monday.  * The average speed of trains between JFK/UMass and
Braintree (southbound) increased from 16.46 MPH on September 5th to 25.36 MPH on
Monday.  * Headways for northbound service on the Braintree Branch decreased
from 14 minutes to 12 minutes.  **BIG PICTURE: T officials say yesterday was the
first time in at *least a decade* that there were no Red Line slow zones south
of JFK/UMass.**

I cannot help but think about the Federal Transit Administration's Safety
Management Inspection of the MBTA. On transit a single death and a few safety
incidents is treated as unacceptable, requiring mitigation and direct efforts to
address, as it should be. I was worried about safety theater and hollowing out
service under Baker (I think that was founded and his orange line shut down was
a joke), but under Eng these requirements seem to really be helping make transit
better. They worked that way in DC too.      Anyway, what would happen if we
treated this constant litany of incidents on our roadways the same way? would we
even have highways at all? What if deaths on the roadway or identified danger
areas resulted in speed restrictions and systemic investigations in order to
improve safety? What if this was covered as a problem with our roadways at all,
rather than asa series of isolated incidents usually blamed on individuals?
Feels like these are questions worth asking.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is scrambling to cut costs,
attract new dollars, and curry political favor to avert a financial crisis, but
fare increases are not yet on the table. Nor are they off the menu.  “Increases
in fares — in general — is something that is always discussed,” MBTA General
Manager Phillip Eng said during an interview at the 2024 Globe Summit. Later in
the discussion referring to fare increases, he added: “Those are things we have
to look at.”  The MBTA is facing a looming budget crisis next year that will
take hundreds of millions of dollars to avert. Still, Eng emphasized that he
would seek grants and other assistance from federal agencies and push employees
to work more efficiently, emphasizing cost-cutting measures over fare increases.
He also made it clear that he doesn’t think fares can solve the problem.  “You
cannot fund the T on the backs of riders and the public,” Eng said. “Quite
frankly, it would be unaffordable if we tried to fund the T strictly on fares.”
Currently, about 19 percent of the T’s expenses are covered by fares, with the
remainder coming from sales taxes, local assessments, federal funds, and other
external   Eng also said he would “continue dialogue” with the White House and
federal agencies to alleviate the T’s deficit, emphasizing that transportation
authorities across the country are in similar dire financial straits. Though Eng
didn’t outright deny that fares would increase as a result of the looming
financial crisis, he said the MBTA must keep fares affordable.  “What we are
trying to do is make sure it’s safe, reliable and affordable, so even if those
discussions are had, it has to be what is affordable for folks, given the rising
costs of everything in today’s age,” Eng said.

From what I understand. The track improvement program will get rid of all the
slow zones by the end of 2024. This has been so far going in the right direction
and it will be amazing when they're all removed. I hope over time, the
reliability/speed will make more people take the T.   But I remember some
members in this community saying that the signals are the next step in helping
make the T infrastructure more reliable and faster. We experienced problems when
a signal was faulty around Forest Hills stop as a prime example.  My question
is, since the T is working on improving the tracks, why can't they also work on
upgrading the analog signals to it's desired digital infrastructure? Is there
something I'm missing? I just want to understand the whole process so if someone
can answer, it'd be greatly appreciated!

 In the aftermath of a power outage that halted subway service in Boston and
left riders in darkness on Tuesday, MBTA General Manager Phil Eng answered
questions about the blackout.  The problem struck just after 1:30 p.m., causing
service to grind to a halt on the Blue, Green, Orange and Red lines. Trains were
ordered to stand by at stations.  Video from passengers showed trains stopped
beside darkened platforms. Riders also said that air conditioning was stopped.
"There was a power surge outside of system but right near our operations center
it did affect all of our lines and all of our signals," Eng said on Wednesday.
After power was restored, signal problems continued to slow the return to full
service.  "When the signals go dark and when the signals are out of
correspondence, it means we have to supplement with a lot of manual operations,"
Eng said. "And the time to get people in place to do that was lengthy,
unfortunately."  While Eng said the power surge originated outside of the MBTA's
system, he was still waiting on Wednesday for more information about the cause.
He also said that his team will examine ways to protect the system against
similar surges in the future.  "I know it inconvenienced people as they got
caught within the system, but our focus is on safety, and then how do restore
service faster and then, going forward, how do we make our system more resilient
to these types of issues," said Eng.

Need a flair for like pleading for communication.   I know the MBTA can't
respond to every single thing, but with weeklong signal issues at forest hills
and the switch problem at oak grove, it'd be really helpful/encouraging as the T
works to regain trust to have a public statement acknowledging this is an issue
and giving some sort of indication on when we can expect it to be fixed.   Maybe
that's forthcoming, maybe I'm impatient, and maybe they'll fix it before it
becomes essentially a new slow zone (in areas where slow zones haven't been
worked on yet, I get that). But I just feel like the T could do more to
communicate as it seems to regain trust, and that goes for every single line not
just orange.   Eng is an engineer and is clearly getting massive amounts done,
but the communications team at the T does not do enough to fulfill the overall
trust mission IMO.   Also get that this year is a rebuilding year, and perhaps
communication will improve once the system is through this yearlong phase.
Curious to hear others thoughts specifically re: communication

This would be at least the 5th time a derailed vehicle has suspended service
across the MBRA. (Kenmore and Broadway has seen derailed trains, while Park
Street, Wollaston, and the Blue Line has had maintenance vehicles derailed)
This now has brought into question the safety of these maintenance vehicles and
whether Middlesex (the organization contracted to work with the MBTA on the
Track Improvement Program) or the MBTA are to blame for the usage of
malfunctioned equipment for track work repair because this is now the 3rd time
this has happened.   Expect delays on the Orange Line as a result of the switch
issue until further notice.

Anyone else encounter this? The only time this driver stopped spamming the bell
was to speak incredibly loudly over the speakers to give unnecessarily long
information. Im getting off at my stop and he blows the horn about as loud as
possible despite the fact there are no incoming cars and the bell spamming. I
said “Jesus fucking christ” because it was as loud as possible and i was

# Why?  This shutdown is being executed to remove slow zones and do station
maintenance. There are currently **11 speed restrictions** between Kendall and
Alewife. They plan to **remove 9-10 of them**. This will result in round trip
**travel times being cut by at least 4 minutes.**    # What Are The
Alternatives?  **Shuttle Buses**  3 shuttle bus routes will run:  * Local
Shuttles making stops at all closed stations * Express shuttle buses making
stops at Alewife, Porter, and Kendall * A shuttle bus loop serving Harvard,
Central, and Kendall, before going back to Harvard (it's unclear if this will
serve Central Outbound)     **Regular Bus:**  * Route 77 will be free withing
Cambrige. This is a key bus route, with frequent service. It stops between
Alewife and Davis, and at Porter before terminating at Harvard * Route 83 will
**NOT** be fare free, but it stops at Alewife and Porter before terminating at
Central.    **Commuter Rail:**  * The Fitchburg Line will be fare free between
Porter and North Station. Trains will be running **every 30 minutes** on
weekdays, and **every 2 hours on weekends.**     **Community Path:**  * The
Somerville Community Path connects Davis and Magoun Square Stations (it's less
than 20 minutes from Magoun Square to Park Street). This section of path is just
under a mile, and is a really nice walk or bike ride, as you don't have to deal
with much traffic. The path and Alewife Linear park also extend out to Alewife.
**Reminder: The Green Line Extension will be CLOSED on July 13-14.**    # Notes:
* The shuttle buses and regular buses will likely be very crowded and slow. If
you can walk, bike, or take the Commuter Rail, please do, so that space can be
made for seniors or people with disabilities who have no choice but to use the
buses. * **PLAN FOR EXTRA TIME.** Again, the shuttle buses and regular buses
will be VERY SLOW, and likely so crowded that you have to wait as multiple buses
go by in order to get on one. This will especially be a problem closer to
downtown. * The GLX will be closed on July 13-14, nixing some alternatives. * If
there are any questions, I will do my best to answer them.    # Sources/Further

My understanding is that if there isn't a bus shelter, the MBTA bus stops
somewhere between the bus stop signs. I also believe that buses pull to the
curb, unless blocked by illegally parked cars. This is what I've seen at this
stop, for years and years. Recently, I've been yelled at twice by the same
driver. They stopped the bus in a travel lane, at the furthest bus sign, only
because they are at a red light. They yell loudly in front of everyone that I'm
in the wrong place and the driver doesn't have to open the door and let me on
the bus. I'm at the bus stop, on the sidewalk. Seems bizarre to me. And of
course, not a real problem, but I don't look forward to getting that driver in
the future.

I'm a new commuter doing a long commute into Boston, and I'm not very familiar
with the city. This morning in South Station, a man "tailed" me through the
turnstile to get on the Silver Line while mumbling something. I was startled and
turned. He appeared to be a homeless man, and I accidentally made brief eye
contact--it was hard not to, he was very close, and had startled me. I looked
away, and did not say anything. He asked me if I was going to hit him, and I
moved away. He then followed me to the Silver Line while repeatedly threatening
to "knock all my teeth out". He followed me onto the Silver Line.  He then got
off at the same station I did (Courthouse), and continued to follow me
aggressively while threatening to knock all my teeth out. Of course, I wouldn't
have gotten off the Silver Line (and would've called 911) had I known he was
going to continue to follow me, but I didn't know/think that he would. There
weren't many people in the station (just some young high-schooler-age-looking
people who didn't look like they would help), so it was alarming.  Fortunately,
there was an MBTA employee nearby the top of the escalator. I explained what was
happening, and the employee walked me up to the street. The aggressive man
followed at a distance. The employee told me to keep going, and that he would
stop the man. The aggressive man started to follow, and the MBTA employee
stopped him. I looked back a few times to make sure the MBTA employee was not
being assaulted (he wasn't), and hurried to work.  I reported this to MBTA
security. I was advised that I should've been more confident and empathetic, and
tried to talk to the man and explain that I did not have a problem with him. I'm
not a city person, and Boston is new to me, but I thought the correct approach
was to *not* engage and to move away?  Some more context: I'm a short male, have
to dress well for my new job, and do probably look like an easy target. The man
seemed to be on drugs.  Questions:  * Is the MBTA security officer's advice
sound, or should I not engage? * Should I have called 911 when I realized how
serious the situation was in Courthouse Station? Or would that have made things
worse, and resulted in a too-slow-to-help response from police anyway? * Is
going from South Station to Courthouse (Seaport) a dangerous route? I've been
told that it was a relatively safe route and that the Seaport is a relatively
safe area, especially during the morning/day. * What else should I have done
differently?  Thank you in advance for the advice.  **Edit:** Thank you so much
for all the advice and info.  I will follow the consensus advice.  It's also
good to know that this was a very atypical situation for this area/route.

So someone posted about possible hearing issues from the screech of the green
line at government center. Has anyone thought about the health issues from the
diesel fumes that cr trains emit? Back bay is a great example of this. Only the
amtrak trains on the nec are electrified, meaning the other trains at the
station emit fumes. The news has said in the past that work was being looked
into to mitigate this with new air systems &amp; better ventilation. It's been
years since any updates from what I've found. Since I don't live near the train
station I use, I can't speak personally to the effects of smelling &amp;
breathing those fumes regularly. I understand when keolis said they wanted to
run emus on the fairmount line, they brought up environmental issues &amp;
remedies to make up for the issues. Thats completely understandable given that
there's a disparity between communities that are more impacted than others. In
fact, how dose that disparity play out? Whats the environmental &amp; community
impact when we compare different lines &amp; their communities? How is Worcester
different from Providence or Fitchburg compared to Salem? My point is that we
can take this issue, look into it &amp; come up with a solution that makes
everyone happy. But this is all assuming things worked out perfectly &amp; we
all know that's not happening. There are many complicated things that need to
work themselves out to reach a good end result. But thats a problem for another
day.

I'll admit I'm asking this question out of total ignorance and just throwing
this out there.  Also, given the T's financial crisis, this most likely isn't
going to happen.    However, as anyone who subscribes to alerts for the BL knows
every day there is an alert about "10 minute delays while crew inspects the
overhead wires."  Also in the past there have been bustitutions because of wire
problems.  Not to mention, overhead wires are vulnerable to storms.    So my
question is would it make sense in the long run to replace the entire line with
third rail, therefore eliminating the aforementioned issues?     An aside
question, does the Green Line also have these problems with their OH wires?  I
ask because I don't subscribe to GL alerts.  If the GL doesn't have the same
type of problems, than what is unique about the BL OH wires that make them
vulnerable to problems?

Title: MBTA is 'barely treading water', may begin doing major cut of MBTA service in 2026 (via CommonBeacon)

Posted: 2024-06-12 12:06:31 UTC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLDR: The MBTA has tons of projects it simply does not have the money to
currently fund, such as the SL3 Extension to Everett and Sullivan, redesign of
the JFK/UMass station, the Red-Blue connector, etc. If the MBTA does not close
the now 700 million dollar deficit by next year for fiscal year 2026, it will
have to consider cutting MBTA service like what was proposed in 2021. The
financial issue can be contributed to the sales tax revenue not growing to what
was predicted (2.29 percent now versus ~6.5-8.5 percent predicted) and
decreasing fare collections/monthly passes and ridership.   MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF ARTICLE:  The MBTA’ board of directors has signed off on a $3 billion budget,
as well as a capital investment plan, keeping the public transit agency’s
flickering lights on in the coming fiscal year starting July 1. The fiscal 2025
budget, which is 11 percent higher than the previous fiscal year, was infused
with spending from reserves to close a funding gap and help pay for a hiring
spree.  But it’s the next fiscal year, 2026 – along with the projects the agency
hasn’t been able to invest in – that drew concern from board members as they met
Tuesday.  “We have 13 months to figure out how we’re going to solve the problem”
of a $700 million funding gap for the T, said Tom Glynn, a former T general
manager who now chairs the oversight board.  Otherwise, the agency will be
forced to consider massive service cuts. “Cutting of service is not going to
solve our problems. In fact it’ll send us in the wrong direction,” said Phil
Eng, the T’s current general manager. “We’re going to keep making the case to
fund the T. The economy and public life thrives with mass transportation, and I
think others who are going to help us solve this are fully aware of the need to
find a way to support our needs.”  Sales tax revenue “grossly underperformed
expectations” over the last two decades, hitting an average annual growth rate
of 2.29 percent rather than the 6.46 to 8.50 percent, according to a
presentation from T staff. That amounts to between $8.9 to $15.5 billion in lost
revenue, and as Brian Kane, executive director of MBTA’s advisory board, put it,
the agency has been left “holding the bag.”  Separately, ridership appears to
have plateaued, and fare revenue remains at roughly 60 percent of pre-pandemic
levels. Riders have also shifted away from monthly passes and moved to storing
value on their CharlieCards and single tickets. (Pre-pandemic, half of fare
revenue came from monthly passes.)  The MBTA’s board also signed off on a
five-year capital budget, totaling $9.6 billion and covering 640 projects. The
list includes replacement of a 1930s drawbridge by North Station, bridge fixes,
repairs to stairs and lighting at various stations, and new buses, among others.
But the unfunded projects – not included in the capital budget “despite their
importance to the MBTA’s strategic goals – also drew the attention of board
members, as did the $24 billion needed to bring the system’s assets into a state
of good repair. The unfunded projects include an overhaul of the JFK Red Line
Station, accessibility improvements to the Orange Line’s Chinatown Station, a
bus maintenance facility, and expansions such as the Red-Blue connector and a
Silver Line extension.  But after the board meeting, Glynn, the board chair,
said he’s optimistic that state officials can come to a solution on the MBTA’s
fiscal woes.  A veteran of state government who also served as the CEO of
Massport, the agency that runs Logan Airport, Glynn pointed to the Boston Harbor
cleanup, the Big Dig and health care reform. “When the community gets together
and decides something is an important enough priority, they’ve always figured it
out somehow,” he said. “And those were all big complicated things.”

Hi everyone. For background info and by way of explaining why I’m not good at
this yet—I’m a southern girl who grew up in very rural Georgia. I’ve lived in NH
for 20 years but only recently moved to southern NH (in the past 2 years). My
kids and I love Boston and find ourselves going there a lot more often for day
trips and such. The last several times we’ve just been just driving down and
trying to find parking wherever, which is a huge headache. I would like to
become familiar with using the commuter rail and the T. Next week is spring
break and we’d love to visit the city; see some of the popular places such as
Chinatown, Faneuil Hall, etc. I want to take the commuter rail from Haverhill to
North Station. We’d also like to use the T to get around while in Boston. I can
read the PDF schedules on the website and theoretically know what to do, but in
practical terms, I’m pretty unfamiliar with the whole process. Can someone
please walk me through how to purchase a ticket for the commuter rail and what
to expect in terms of using the ticket, and also how to purchase a ticket for
the T and how to navigate the different colored lines (Red Line, Green Line,
etc) according to where we might want to go? Explain it to me like I’m a 12 year
old. Please also note that part of my problem is I battle ADHD and anxiety.
Adulting is hard sometimes. Lol Thank you!!

I can’t understand why the T is not able to keep consistent headways on the red
line, with the target 8 min usually falling anywhere between 3 and 15 min. I
thought the reason was issues with signals or other problems, but bunching also
occurs without any apparent problem. This morning my red line train stopped at
Porter for almost 10 minutes without any reason given, resulting in a large
headway between our train and the one before us, and causing the train behind us
to catch up. Why do such things happen?

This post will be updated with more information as it is released.  EDIT 1: Just
got a notification from ProxmiT that Blue Line service is suspended between
Bowdoin and Suffolk Downs due to a catenary (the wires that the Green and Blue
Lines use in order to power themselves) wire issue. This means that Blue Line is
only available at Suffolk Downs, Beachmont, Revere Beach, and Wonderland.  EDIT
2: Channel 5 announced that the catenary cable caused a disabled train, which
was heading to Wonderland at the time of the issue. Everyone was safe and were
escorted to Orient Heights. NBC Boston further stated that the issue is
specifically “one of the roof-mounted pantographs that connects with overhead
wires to power the trains”. The T is warning about delays since shuttles are
also replacing Commuter Rail service at South Station and Braintree. (Thank you
to user u/Eltiempo10 for the update.)  EDIT 3: Power Department is on scene
responding to the catenary wire issue. Shuttles continue operating.  EDIT 4:
Channel 5 reports: “‘The train lost power after it experienced problems with its
roof-mounted pantographs, which connect with the overhead wire,’ a] spokesperson
wrote. ‘The cause of the pantograph failure is under investigation.’ According
to the MBTA, 30 shuttle buses are replacing Blue Line service between Bowdoin
and Suffolk Downs while the MBTA Power Department addresses the issue as safely
and quickly as possible”.  EDIT 5: Blue Line service is continuing to be
shuttled as repairs are being finalized to the overhead wires. Expect shuttles
to be phased out within the next 2-3 hours. Channel 5 adds more information
about this particular issue: “An MBTA spokesperson said in a written statement
that at approximately 5:10 p.m., there was a report of a disabled train on the
eastbound track near Orient Heights. The MBTA said a train with approximately
180 passengers on board was evacuated with the assistance of Boston Fire
personnel”. WBZ also noted that “T riders said they saw electric sparks and were
told they had to get off the train and walk 500 feet of train tracks to the
station”.

I've been trying to figure this out recently - for years I've kept my card in my

seems like I get the "please retry" rejection increasingly often - sometimes
two, three, four times before it goes through.  This happens less on buses
(although it did happen today a couple of times) and more often on the newer
subway fare readers, although it wasn't previously that frequent.  Is anyone
else having these issues?  I thought I'd figured out that maybe I was just
tapping it "wrong" (and sometimes I've dodged it by being very careful about
centering the chip) but I never used to have to try this hard.

I think that Ashkenazy Acquisitions Corp (aka the company that owns the lease on
South Station and, until recently, Faneuil Hall, is having cashflow problems.
They recently defaulted on a $195M loan for an NYC property and a $61M loan for
a Magnificent Mile property in Chicago is teetering. Apparently they also made
some big bets on CRE investments in SF pre-pandemic, are being sued by tenants
from one of their NYC residential properties, and refinanced several loans on
other properties. They claim to have $12B in assets, but it’s unclear if that
has been marked down to reflect the drop in the post Covid CRE market, and since
they are private it is hard to understand their current capital structure.   I
think the financial woes probably have a lot to do with why they refuse to put
any money into repairs at south station. They just don’t have the money and what
cash they do have they need to cover their other legal battles.

I take the bus quite frequently and as a newcomer to the New England area, I'm
realizing the practicalities of a (protected) bus lane are not always feasible.
There are quite a few (parts of) routes that go through neighborhoods with only
one lane in each direction or on small, narrow (by American standards) roads,
thereby getting stuck in the same traffic as all other cars.  One way to
encourage bus ridership is to make it more convenient than driving but that's
not really possible when the buses take twice as long simply as driving because
there are too many other cars.  What, if any, are some practical solutions to
fixing the bus problem?

In order to solve bunching problems on the Red Line, the MBTA is sometimes
running express trains from Harvard to Alewife, without stopping at Porter and
Davis. I was on one today, and the conductor spent 3 additional minutes at
Harvard going to every car, making sure that passengers for Porter and Davis had
left the train. Since 3 minutes is equivalent to the time saved by not stopping
at Porter and Davis, these express trains are not only disruptive for passengers
bound to Porter or Davis, but also ineffective at solving the bunching issues. I
really hope an MBTA employee sees this post and passes the message along to the
MBTA operation control center.

Is it a staffing problem? Are the slow zones just causing trains to take longer
to get to stations, making the gaps longer? Is it both? Either way, are there
plans to solve this by end of year along with slow zone elimination (or
hopefully sooner)?  I realize there's already a lot being worked on, and I

Hi, everyone!   Today I want to talk about ways the T (and Keolis) can improve
the CR system.   The biggest problem is the long wait between trains. I’ve heard
of people who waited almost 30+ for a train. Running trains more often will
allow people to use the CR without having to base their schedule around it.  The
North-South Link is also something I find really interesting because connecting
the two could be a game changer (especially with North Station being under TD
Garden). I do not know if rails would be the most affordable option if the T
implements a SL line connecting the two (possibly SL6?).  Electrification is
something that is also vital to transforming the system. If the T or Keolis can
electrify the entire system and bring in new trains it would make journeys more
enjoyable.  Finally, expanding the CR into NH and Western Mass will allow people
who normally had no access to transit to now have it and may even allow the T to
gain more support statewide in terms of increasing funding for other projects.

I use a monthly pass for the commuter rail, purchased via autopay. It seems that
more often than not, the CharlieTicket functionality of the pass either never
works or fails partway through the month. I tap it, and often try multiple
station gates, but it doesn't register.  Do other have this problem too? Am I
handling or storing my pass wrong? I've tried both carrying it in a clear sleeve
on the back of my phone case so that it's easier to show the CR conductors, as
well as keeping it in my wallet. Doesn't seem to matter. On top of that, I have
to take it out of even that thin plastic sleeve to tap it else it doesn't work.
When I still lived in Boston proper and had a recurring pass on a plastic
CharlieCard, it always scanned fine still in the sleeve... ugh.

Writing with a problem that others MUST have. I use a commuter card (through
work / Health Equity) to buy Charlie cards / add value historically. This is
technically a debit card with no PIN. Traditionally you could use this card to
add stored value online, but they don’t work at the fare machines.   The
problem: now with that ability removed from the site, I have no idea if there’s
any way to add value to my card using this commuter card.   Does anyone know how
to work around this???

Anybody else notice an uptick in delays this fall?  Yesterday morning, the train
was almost an hour late.  Yesterday afternoon, the engine had a problem and we
had to switch trains.  This morning, something is wrong with the engine AGAIN,
and we have been at a standstill for 15 minutes with no update and no end in
sight.  These issues don’t seem all event related (like a storm / downed trees).
Is there some reason why it’s gotten so bad lately?  The Fitchburg line used to
be reliable…

I got caught  in the C/D branch shuttle shuffle last night. Started at Arlington
just as they announced the pantograph problem at Kenmore and shuttle service
replacement. Walked to Copley, waited for 20 minutes with no shuttles in sight.
Bailed and called a Lyft - a choice validated when I saw the massive crowds
waiting outside Kenmore.   It seems like the green line is suddenly having lots
of problems with pantographs. Is the really a new thing, or are they just now
sharing more details instead of just announcing “mechanism problems” or
“disabled train”? If it’s a new thing, what suddenly changed to cause problems
so frequently?

the state was recently granted a ton of money to create a state intercity rail
line from Boston to Springfield with the hope of eventually extending to
Pittsfield or Albany. this is an important step in the right direction as
western mass is in desperate need of a better connection with Boston. but i
thought what if they did a study for a second line that would go from Boston to
greenfield via the Fitchburg line ROW.  currently greenfield is served by
Amtrak's Vermonter service but there is no direct connection to Boston. I've
seen some of the unused line from Wachusett to greenfield and it looks like it
could still be used with refurbishment.   another benefit would be restoring
rail service to Gardner which i think is big enough to warrant it being an
intermediate stop, I'd have Littleton, Fitchburg and Gardner as intermediate
stops.  my biggest question is, is this feasible? is there that many people that
would commute between greenfield and Boston? another thing that could be a
problem the length of the ride. the mbta actually had commuter rail service to
Gardner in the 80s but decided to stop it because the length of the trip was
increased because the tracks past Fitchburg are in a hilly area and become very
curved causing the speeds to become greatly reduced which could be an issue.
if you really wanna dream big you could about extending the line to North Adams
but that probably wouldn't happen for a long time.

I decided to leave my apartment to try and have some fun before work, since I
get out at 10pm. Easy, I thought. I'll go to my favorite antique store! It's
right next to Lechmere. Even if I stay too long, I work right next to Copley! It
won't be a problem at all. And I live pretty close to the B line, so it's an
easy transfer at Government Center if I want to go further.   Two hours later
I'm only just getting to North Station, not even my final destination. I'm in a
bad enough mood that I wanted to flip off the signs at Park Street saying
(lying) that trains were running every 7 to 13 minutes. After a 30 minute bus
ride I was standing around waiting another 30 minutes. I just wanted to spend a
few hours digging through overpriced trash before a soulsucking closing shift,
was that too much to ask?  ETA: They fixed it thank God.

&gt;The T shut down train service on the entire Green Line extension Friday
afternoon and forced some riders to walk along the tracks after a problem with
the overhead electrical system, according to a tweet from the agency and a
reporter who was among the passengers on a stalled train eventually asked to
proceed on foot.   &gt;   &gt;The extraordinary scene came a day after general
manager Phillip Eng revealed widespread track problems on the newest part of the
T’s subway system. It wasn’t immediately clear how long the Friday rush hour
shutdown would last, and the T didn’t immediately specify what went wrong with
the overhead electrical system.   &gt;   &gt;Shuttle buses were replacing
service between North Station and the ends of both Green Line extension
branches, Medford/Tufts and Union Square in Somerville, as of around 4 p.m.
&gt;   &gt;At least one train stopped between Lechmere and East Somerville
stations for over an hour before T employees evacuated all of the passengers,
perhaps 100 people, and walked them along the tracks to exit, according to the
Globe reporter on board.  (For a moment, I thought I was reading The Onion)

Title: "Old" Fare Gates May Use Your CharlieCard's Stored Value Before Using Your Monthly Pass - Confirmed at Ashmont Only

My wife and I have monthly passes on our CharlieCards but still keep some stored
value on them for tailgating friends and family. Family visited a few weeks ago
and we realized almost all of the stored value previously on our cards was gone.
Ran an experiment over the course of a non-consecutive few days ($2.40 in the
name of science!), and it appears that the "old" fare gates (the ones without
the new screen on them) may use the stored value on your CharlieCard and not the
monthly pass. We tested this at Ashmont only, but this could be the case
elsewhere. And not sure if it happens every time (we only tried it in the
morning, so maybe it's a morning thing). So if you keep stored value and a
monthly pass on your CharlieCard at the same time (not sure how common this is),
be on the lookout for this (especially if you go through Ashmont in the
morning)!  Experiment Details: Wife enters through "new" fare gate and confirms
that her monthly pass is used. I enter through "old" fare gate and confirm that
stored value is used. I quickly exit the system, then re-enter through a "new"
fare gate (at the same station) and confirm that the monthly pass is now used.
EDIT: Flipped the process on a different day (wife became designated
money-loser). Also tried the second lobby at Ashmont on another day. Same
problem in all situations.

Naively I would have assumed that the mbta was aware in advance that the glx was
going to open and would have spent the week ahead of opening updating the maps
in trains and stations. (Presumably trains and stations are cleaned and
inspected very frequently, and putting up new maps could be part of that
process.)  Instead it feels as if the mbta didn't know they were going to need
new maps until after it opened and someone pointed out the problem. Even today
there are still green line stations and green line trains with old maps!

arrive at the exact same time instead of being spread apart, which is always

I live near Harvard and sometimes take the 66 bus home from the grocery store.
Allegedly, the closest stop to my house is [Mt Auburn St at University
Rd](https://www.mbta.com/stops/2074). I'd love to get off the bus there, since
it saves me several minutes and a flight of stairs versus the stop in the
busway. However, I've never successfully gotten a 66 driver to stop there,
despite requesting the stop with plenty of time. Today I asked the driver about
it and he told me the 66 doesn't actually stop there. However, the 66 is listed
on the physical sign at the stop, the stop is on all of the online schedules for
the 66, and the stop is audibly announced on the bus.  A few competing
hypotheses:   1) This is a new stop for the 66 (I think this is true?) and
drivers aren't consistently aware of it 2) Drivers think the stop is annoying
and would rather skip it 3) There's been some kind of disconnect with the
signage/schedules and the 66 is not actually supposed to stop there  I wouldn't
really mind except that I'm often carrying heavy grocery bags!  Any thoughts?
Any ideas on who to contact to figure this out?

Realistically, I think most people don't know that they're supposed to remove

to read the MBTA rules.   I get annoyed when people play audio over their phone
speakers. I used to think that it was common knowledge that that was rude. At

it's okay.  Instead of expecting people to know a bunch of unspoken rules, the

before they eventually changed it or if this is just an old stop that’s no
longer in service - Downtown Crossing is just Washington street - Charles/MGH is
just Charles street - last northbound stop is Harvard! I noticed the other day
one of the plaques at Davis station said it was established in 1984 so it’s cool
to think this is a map from 50-60 years ago. I could be wrong on that but still
very cool!  I know the old trains are annoying and break down all the time, but

to them for miles and miles. It seems like a big distraction, first of all. It
also just seems so irritating. Most of the time drivers aren't responding
anyway, and people keep talking even when the plexiglass barrier is closed.
Sometimes it seems like they might actually know each other, or maybe the driver
is just chatty, but I just feel bad for them!

Title: Why does the Green Line do this?

This has happened several times and I'm really curious. I take the Green Line
daily from Park Street westbound towards Copley; let's say a D train pulls in. I
board, and we wait. And wait. And wait. Then, a C train pulls in, boards, and
departs, then a B train, and only after does that B train leave do we depart.
It's really annoying - if the D train was here first, and the next train is
behind us by 3 minutes (I've waited up to 8 in this pattern), why would it make
sense for us to wait? We end up waiting behind the other trains at each stop
anyway because of this. Anyone got any insight?  (Side note: this morning was a
pain in the ass - seriously, 3 E trains in a row? The one line I can't take
lmao)

Hello!  I cannot for the life of me purchase a Commuter Rail ticket from the
mTicket app.  Every time I enter my information and try to pay, I get the error
"SDK: purchase.173".  What's extra annoying is the payment seemingly goes
through and is marked as processing with my bank, yet no ticket or receipt is
delivered.  I am using a Google Pixel 7 Pro with the most recent Android update
and I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app.  If anyone has any
suggestions, they are much appreciated.

I ride an MBTA bus to school maybe once or twice a week. Sometimes things on the
bus are not working or I get shuffled along so I’m not sure what I’m supposed to
be able to do.  I have a paper ticket loaded with money still on it. Can I still
use that?  I have a CharlieCard which I have never used before. I’m supposed to
be able to load money onto this on the bus, yeah? Last time I tried to do it but
the bill wasn’t reading and the told me to just go. I don’t usually go to
stations with kiosks for CharlieCards.  Can I pay cash if I bring $1.75, no
ticket or card involved? (I have a lot of spare change in my house lol). If you
were the bus driver would you be annoyed at me for doing this?  TIA.

EDIT: OL was back in service at around 6:30. Posts will be coming about any slow
zones removed and what each station looks like now soon. :)  Also a reminder
that while this is annoying, at the very least work is being done to completion
and isn’t being left undone. The T is a system that is facing severe issues, and
not doing track work at this point is both dangerous and will not improve subway
service. I would much rather have track that works and provide fast service than
have lackluster infrastructure with the protection of derailing or catching on
fire. (Which is why pushing your state legislators to fund and support the T
with more resources and activism will do more overall than simply complaining
about the T and expecting them to fix the system as a result).

Mechanical issues. What’s new?  What is really getting to me is that a

Other trains on this line have the same issue, and often. Are they really
slacking this much on maintenance? It’s so fucking annoying.  Edit: side

minutes to its origin point. How is any of this making sense.

A lot of people have been complaining about the Green Line today (and saw a post
about fare evading), so I decided to make this post so people can better
understand WHY these delays happen.  The defunding of the T first started under
Gov. Weld and Baker (the same Baler who would become Governor himself). They
used money that was originally supposed to be used for the T and instead used it
for the Big Dig. Since then, many of the governors we have had continued this
pattern or defunding.  In addition, many GMs until Eng simply glossed over the
track decay that was happening or did not have the staff or funds to actually
fix the tracks. As this continued to happen, the issues with old trains (which
will inevitably break down due to time) began to grow because the T had no
support to get new trains.  This has basically led to the current system we have
today, where headways are over 10-15+ minutes and train breakdowns are common.
Now, before complaining/bit**ing about the T, please understand:  1.) Do not be
mad at the T or their workers; many of them use the T themselves and are just as
annoyed as you are. They are people and deserve respect.  2. ) Be mad at the
state for not doing enough to support the T, financially and otherwise. Healey,
for example, is only increasing funds to ~50 million dollars for a system that
will need 24 billion dollars to bring the system to a state of good repair AND
is facing a financial cliff next year (basically, the T will have no extra money
to run anything).  3. ) Instead of making fun of the T, email the Governor.
Email Mayor Wu and other mayors services by the T. Support transit
organizations. Make your voice heard.  (BTW, shoutout to BeautifulGlove for all
of their work to provide more information about the T. You are a real one.)

On Monday I made a post complaining about how they make us pay for riding one
stop during a shutdown. Well, I was running late again and I knew the risk I was
taking this time but decided it would be better than being ten minutes late
again. Lo and behold, it was the same conductor. Fine. I run out of money so I
load my card and she doesn’t say anything. About one minute later, she announces
that the train in front of us is stuck and we can either walk to Babcock or wait
for an unspecified amount of time. So I ended up walking anyway after paying the
$2.40 fare.   Even if it’s stingy, paying for a service is understandable. But I
didn’t even get to ride it. She waited for me to load my card and didn’t bother
warning me, even though the train in front of us had already been stopped for a
while at this point. Seriously?  Edit: I knew this time that service terminated
at Babcock but I was running late so I thought it would be faster to take the T
than walking. I’m annoyed because I had to pay and still ended up walking. I
also want to add that something similar happened last week (before the
shutdown); I boarded at Amory St and when we arrived at Babcock the conductor
randomly announced service was terminated and that the next train was coming in
20min. No idea what that was about

Hello everyone, it's your favorite transit cartographer. I've come back for some
advice from people that know more about the CR than I do.  * Why dear god is
this system such a mess???????????  * Going off the new timetables, it seems the
super express Boston-Framingham-Worcester train is dead? Can anyone confirm? *
The upcoming Haverhill Line shows trains running express to Ballardvale,
presumably via the Wildcat branch. Will these trains stop at Anderson RTC or
not? * Is there a pattern to what trains stop at Hyde Park? From what I've
gathered Franklin/Foxboro Line trains sometimes stop going outbound, but never
inbound, and Stoughton Trains always stop when going inbound, but usually not
outbound, and Providence Trains rarely stop, except on weekends when they always
do.   * Again, what the actual fuck   And now I need advice from people in
general. How should I show on the map:  * No service on weekends * Local service
only * Limited service * ~~Limited service except weekends~~ * Short turns:
Should stations after the short turn point get a limited service (except
weekends) symbol, or should the short turn point be marked as a terminus and
then the reader just assumes that whatever the stations after the short turn are
marked as only applies to trains that don't terminate? Or maybe there's other
options? * Station 'temporarily' closed  So far my options are:  * Regular white
dot for the station * White dot with a solid black circle * White dot with a
hollow black circle * White dot with an X (This will probably be used for closed
stations) * Asterisk on the station name?  What symbols should everything get,
and since I don't have enough symbols for everything, what other symbols should
I use?   Edit: Here's the scheme I'm thinking of:  * Regular white dot means all
trains stop * Solid black circle means local service only * Hollow black circle
means "Limited or Irregular service" * Asterisk on the station name means no
weekend service * Short turn points marked as termini  I think that should cover
most of the edge cases.  Edit 2: Just for fun, here's all the things I've found
that annoy me about the current CR map:  * Terminus stations of rapid transit
lines are bolded, except Chelsea * The Haverhill Line switches sides of the OL
north of the Mystic River * The OL downtown is extremely squiggly * The CR blob
at Forest Hills is in between the two CR branches, not on either (or both) * WTF
is going on at Readville? * Why is Newburyport's station name on the other side
compared to the rest of the branch? There's plenty of space on the other side. *
Plymouth has been removed from the map, but Plimptonville, Hastings, Silver
Hill, Prides Crossing, and Mishawum haven't been. * Why are cardinal directions
abbreviated, even when there is enough space not to, while words like "Center"
or "Junction" are not?

Has anyone noticed new issues with the green line C branch? I feel like up till
now it’s been smoother (for me) than the B or D line when it comes to wait times
and general consistency. But lately… trains are sent out 2x less than usual,
randomly terminating at Park Street some days and Govt Center other days, not to
mention all the slow zones (but that’s not specific to the C line, so I’ll give
it a pass). I know the B line is about to get majorly shut down, but I don’t see
anyone talking about how annoying the C branch has been lately. What gives?

I guess this is technically massport and not MBTA, but the guidance on the
shuttle buses is difficult to figure out, especially if you are from out of
town.  There is no clear signage on where to wait outside the station, the bus
itself doesn’t display all the stops on top, some/most buses don’t announce what
stop they are approaching, and to top it off the drivers always seem annoyed
when you ask them questions.  It gives a really bad impression for people
visiting if they decide to take the blue line in.  I use them somewhat
frequently and still struggle to figure them out sometimes.

Long-time rider of the MBTA. I guess I've taken it for granted that subways
rarely use their horn.  However visiting other cities (particularly
Philadelphia) there seems to be a policy where the subways must honk when
entering tunnels or when going around corners in tunnels.   I've seen major horn
usage on SEPTA and the PATCO High Speed Line.   It's honestly kind of annoying
so in a way I'm glad we don't do it here (particularly with all the turns on the
green line lol). But if it's a rail safety thing, shouldn't the MBTA also be
doing it? Anyone know what this is and why MBTA doesn't do this?

I'm honestly worried about this because it is about 30% of the department,
including people who run the website, the app, digital screens, any tech that
train operators use etc.   It's unclear how the dept is going to recoup the
staff with salaries that allow people to actually afford to live in
Massachusetts. There's no way this doesn't affect the future of all the digital

them. the fares are obviously not making the system high-functioning, and
they’re just charged based on economics not for functionality. the MBTA offers
the fare at the highest price they can to get buy-in without losing too many
customers.   if it makes you so upset to pay while others don’t…. why don’t you

Governor Maura Healey on Monday vowed to crack down on senior MBTA managers who
live hundreds or even thousands of miles away from the transit system they
oversee, calling it “outrageous” that some leaders are working remotely in a
time of crisis.  “You will see quick action on our team’s part in response to
this,” Healey told reporters at the State House. “It is incredibly upsetting to
me that people in senior management, not only don’t they live in Massachusetts,
but are working remotely.”  Healey’s comments came on a day of harsh reaction to
a [Boston Globe
report](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/22/metro/distant-crisis-top-mbta-managers-live-hundreds-or-thousands-miles-troubled-system-theyre-trying-fix/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)
that several key MBTA managers have primary residences that are more than 100
miles from the nearest T station, with some owning homes as far away as Chicago
and Florida.  “We’ve got . . . men and women out there who are working hard
every day out in the field,” Healey said. “But management’s gotta be in the
building. Not just in the building, but on the tracks, in the facilities, in the
garages.”  Healey said her office has already taken action against T managers
who live out of state, apparently referring to a warning given to four managers
last week that they need to work in Boston at least three days a week or find
another job.

So this is something that I’ve noticed but haven’t found a satisfying answer
for. I saw that the T replaced wood sleepers with plastic sleepers on the
rockport line, and that got me to wonder, why not concrete?  Outside of the NEC
and most of the Greenbush line, the T continues to use wooden rail sleepers for
almost its entire network. I understand that the old colony line was originally
refurbished with concrete ties, but a manufacturing error led them to crack
prematurely (and just outside their warranty period). So the T replaced them
with wooden sleepers and was pretty upset with the manufacturer.  Other
passenger railroads like Amtrak use concrete on the NEC with little Issue to my
knowledge and the LIRR somewhat recently refitted portions of its network to
using concrete.   I’ve come to understand that concrete enjoys numerous
advantages over wood and other materials. Advantages such as enabling higher
speeds, requiring less maintenance, it’s overall strength, and it’s sometimes
cheaper to purchase. It seems like the T just got unlucky. Are there good
reasons to keep using wooden sleepers when doing rail replacement or even using
plastic in this case? Would it ever make sense for the T to eventually replace
all of its ties with concrete? Thank you.

days and they make it seem like we’re about to walking into the freaking hunger

from a stop) to South Station then the red line to JFK but we’ve had several
people say that both South Station and the red line (along with the orange line)
are not safe at all due to violence/mental disease and drug use, along with
Downtown Crossing and Park Street. How true is that? From my own research I know
there are some sketchy stations (like Andrew) but we won’t be getting on or off
there. We’ll be traveling during the day (like around rush hour and noonish) and
I know Red is a heavily used line. I don’t imagine it is some kind Mad Max hell
hole but we’ve have a few people make it out to be that way. I’m happy to take
an Uber to JFK and back but I’d really love to not pay that.

All of the past times that I can remember of the Orange line being down, there
were express busses at every station affected that went to North Station.   Now
the only busses offered while the line is down are normal shuttles that go to
every stop. From Wellington it took 45 minutes to get to NS.  This shit is wack
as fuck. How does every single feature that the MBTA adds either gets made worse
or removed. Give us back the express busses at all stops please. I shouldn’t be
needing to wake up an hour earlier to get into Boston.   Edit: Someone gave me a
helpful recommendation. Tried it. It TOOK LONGER. Let me know how these busses
extended my commute by OVER AN HOUR.  They used to have express from Wellington,
now they don’t. I wouldn’t be mad if they never had it, but they had them for 2
years

So the redline is blocked off this week and next from harvard to alewife. They
have known this was going to happen. So they should have double downed to ensure
best experience possible.  I am trying to give them the benefit of doubt and
support.  But seriously : * massive delays through the rest of the system. Yes,
i understand there is a turnaround issue.  But i refuse to accept that they
couldnt handle this better. * normal buses at alewife: as bad as ever.  Delays,
no notice on boards, etc. They could have tried to increase service (not talking
about the shuttles -- bus service).  But no. * commuter rail from north station.
Got on yesterday, delayed 15 minutes.  So of course, missed subsequent bus
connection.  Totally unacceptable.  Beyond the cleanliness and safety questions.
And ideas for new lines  It needs to be *reliable* -- Good headwinds, reliable
schedule, and reliable connections.  People need to be able to get to work on
time, or get home to pick up kids.   We are SO FAR FROM THAT.  My spouse keeps
suggesting "drive".  I dont want to do it.   But it is  hard to support a failed
system that keeps failing up.

conclusions about Greater Boston area transit in the present day that I (and

here—thankful for what exists but also recognizing the missteps and unfulfilled
plans. I would tepidly recommend reading this book if you're into the nuts and

The 55 scheduled bus times is a disaster. Every 50 minutes every single day
under the bus network redesign is just as bad as it is right now. Before
coronavirus, it was a lot better and you had more than one bus at times,
sometimes, 3 back to back all at one time.  Now you have only one bus, every 40
to 50 minutes starting from 9:50am to 4pm right now, currently. That's not good
nor is it the greatest when Drs appointments are scheduled earlier than that and
you have to either drive or take a rideshare.  I've had to reschedule those and
going to work back in the day, around that stupid scheduling which is fine, but
not a lot of times can that be done.

INTERVIEW ON MBTA CAN BE FOUND BELOW:  “‘On transportation infrastructure, when
I started it was kind of a disaster in terms of the state of play at the T, I'll
be honest with you. So I went out, and I recruited [MBTA General Manager] Phil
Eng to come here,’ Healey said. "And I said to him, 'You hire who you need to
hire,' and that includes workers at the T - we were down 1,500 workers when I
started - and also bringing in some new management. He's done that, and I'll
tell you, in just under two years, he has eliminated slow zones. He's given
riders back two million minutes every weekday. Now people are riding the T and
levels are above what they were pre-pandemic.’  But Healey concedes ‘we have a
lot more work to do,’ especially when it comes to finding the money to reverse
the T's massive deficits, which could force service cuts and layoffs in that
newly-reconstituted workforce as soon as next spring.   A crucial upcoming
milestone: the release of her Transportation Funding Task Force's
recommendations. (which will submit their report by Wednesday, when it is due to
Healey. Healey has not received or read the report as of today)”.

Sometimes, details tell a story. Here are South Station we have a good half-inch
of dust everyplace that passengers aren’t clearing it away with their feet. A
head-end power cable just left on the ground untouched for years. A rusted-out
fire extinguisher we hope nobody ever needs.  Taxpayers paid for all these
things. If we need them, why are they left to rot? If we didn’t need them, why
do we have them?  All across the area, the right of way is littered with
abandoned railway junk - sections of rail, rusted-out conduit, stacks of ties:
the right of way just the railroad’s handy (and free) trash dump.  How does this
happen? How does (at South Station) it not bother anyone enough to spend a half
hour with a broom or shop vac once in a rare while?  When a commercial
construction project is wrapping up, part of the contract is always to leave the
site nice and clean. In aviation and maritime industries, cleanliness, order,
and good repair is part of the culture (because disasters happen otherwise).
For rail, the standard is apparently “as long as the train can get through, it’s
fine”.   I think it’s an indicator of the kind of culture the present system is
apparently encouraging. Apathy. “Not my job”. And this is just the face that the
public can see.

Once again, the T’s lack of maintenance and basic safety checks could have
contributed to a disaster.  The “disabled” train jamming the southbound RL this
afternoon is disabled because the doors won’t open. For about 8 minutes,
passengers were stuck on the train at the platform. They finally managed to
unlatch just long enough for passengers to force the doors.   That was _after_
holding at Park for an extra 4 minutes.  On this train, the PA system wasn’t
working, nor was the emergency intercom passengers were trying to use to alert
the operator.  This left the T completely unable to inform passengers of the
situation or issue instructions.  Disasters often require several “random”
factors to line up, like holes in Swiss cheese. This time three failures lined
up. If there had been one more: a power (ventilation) outage, fire or medical
emergency on board this train,  passengers could have been in real trouble.
It’s why any _responsible_ carrier doesn’t start that first run without being
_sure_ all safety-critical systems are operating properly.

The first bus stop at Babcock has 100-150 people waiting during rush hour at any

I just had 4 buses blow by me and was told we couldn’t get on any of them.
It’s not that hard, make a bus lane, enforce it, and run buses way more
frequently.  I want to see the green line running as smoothly as the next
person, and I’m all for these shutdowns provided they result in visible positive
changes. But when service is disrupted to this degree, the MBTA has to adapt
accordingly. The current shuttle bus frequency and scheduling is insufficient at

**The Boston Globe Editorial Board:**  The horrifying video of a ceiling panel
collapse at Harvard Station, nearly missing a passenger, seemed like a timely
metaphor for a crumbling transit system desperately in need of new leadership
and multiple layers of safety oversight.  The “big stuff” that has long plagued
the MBTA — a fire on the Orange Line, a Red Line passenger killed when his arm
got stuck in a closing door, a Green Line collision — has come to define a
system that the Federal Transit Administration insisted in a scathing report
issued last summer must start prioritizing safety.  Today the riding public can
add crumbling infrastructure to the list of the many woes facing the nation’s
oldest system. Interim General Manager Jeff Gonneville blamed corrosion for the
collapse of a ceiling panel weighing up to 25 pounds and ordered another 76
panels removed and that similar structures systemwide be inspected. And the T’s
answer to a long-dangerous and crumbling stairway at Milton Station? Well, rope
it off until it can be demolished.  Two months ago in her inaugural address
Governor Maura Healey, mindful that “we can’t have a functioning economy without
a functioning T,” pledged to appoint a transportation safety chief within the
next 60 days “to inspect our system, top to bottom and track by track.”  That
was 60 days ago.

or you're 5 mins into a 20+ min wait.  I genuinely don’t understand how they're
so consistently off schedule from each other. I've tried every hour between 2
and 6, and every 15 min interval within those hours. I've looked at multiple
scheduling apps to try to plan the most optimal route. 98% of the time I'm stuck
waiting. No consistency among the 2% where I can grab a bus within 10 mins of
arrival.  Anyone else struggle with this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
here

Does anyone regularly park here?  Is it safe?  Convenient?   Does it get full?
(This is my nightmare - get there and unable to find spot). Cannot find prices
for overnight parking…

The MBTA website has no information on this, the newest schedule doesn't have an
end date on it. The limited service for the past few months has been a nightmare
for getting to/from my job in Woburn. Where can I find information/updates?

Title: MBTA NEWS | MBTA gets $22 million in federal funds for Everett bus improvements (via WBUR)

More than $22 million in federal money is on the way for MBTA bus improvements
in Boston and Everett[…]  An MBTA project was awarded a $22.4 million grant
through the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make "essential
improvements" to bus service along the Lower Broadway and Alford Street corridor
in Everett and Boston, U.S. Sen. Ed Markey's office announced Tuesday. The
funding will cover bus-only lanes, priority signaling for buses and new stop
facilities, Markey's office said.  I am grateful to our federal delegation for
their support of the many years of hard work and collaboration between Everett,
the MBTA, and many others that culminated in the awarding of this grant that
will bring rapid transit to Everett. Bus Rapid Transit along the Broadway
corridor will most importantly improve the daily commutes of thousands of
Everett residents and provide them with greater access to education and
employment options," [Everett Mayor] DeMaria said in a statement to the State
House News Service. "This grant also will provide for expanded public and
multi-modal transportation options that support redevelopment opportunities such
as a potential professional soccer stadium that will uplift Everett and the
region while mitigating concerns about additional congestion from such
projects."  “The MBTA is grateful for this major federal award for the Lower
Broadway Everett Transit Priority Corridor Project, which prioritizes safety and
will improve the commutes of thousands of our bus riders and the Everett
community as a whole through newly constructed bus-only lanes and bus stops,
fully separated bicycle facilities, improved pedestrian amenities, transit
signal priority, and enhanced accessibility along the 1.2-mile Lower Broadway
corridor," MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng said in a statement provided by
Markey's office.  This investment will enhance bus service for the thousands of
Everett and Boston riders, many of whom are Black, brown, and low-income and
rely on buses to get to work, health care, groceries, and childcare," said
Markey, who lives in nearby Malden.  During an April hearing on the bill, Boston
City Council Sharon Durkan warned of traffic nightmares if events were happening
simultaneously at an Everett stadium and TD Garden, located about 2.5 miles
away. Durkan said additional MBTA investments are needed, since the closest
train stop is about a mile away [at] Sullivan Square.  Massachusetts was also
awarded two federal planning grants. Salem will receive $2 million to study
commuter rail expansion and Gardner will get $1.2 million to analyze downtown
"accessibility enhancements."

Title: Bus Question: Transferring From the 86 to the 77 at Harvard

Hi everyone,  I'm so sorry if this isn't the usual type of question that gets
asked in r/mbta, but I'm not sure who else to turn to in my quest for knowledge.
I need to get to an appointment on Wednesday, and (as you can guess by the title
of my post), I need to transfer from the 86 to the 77 at the Harvard stop. I've
ridden the 86 before, but I rode it past Harvard, and IIRC the Harvard bus stop
is a weird underground stop that connects with the Red Line?   My question is:
Do I need to go above ground to catch the 77, or can I catch it in the same
place I get dropped off by the 86? Google doesn't say anything about walking
between the stops, but I don't want  to miss my appointment, and as a physically
disabled person, navigating the MBTA is a bit of a nightmare even when I DO know
what I'm doing.   Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!

The south bound orange line commute since past two days has been a nightmare.
The train randomly stopped between Malden Center and Wellington and was
literally crawling unti Sullivan Square. One of those rare days when I had to
rely on the Green line to get to NEU. Anyone know what’s up because OL was very
prompt
