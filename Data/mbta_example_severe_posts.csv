43,43,1m049wv,Why has South Station absolutely REEKED lately?,"In recent weeks, it has smelled horrible at South Station -- almost like wet
trash that has been sitting out in the sun. It is so unbelievably strong and
unavoidable.   So what is it that I'm smelling? Why is the station generally
such a disappointment lol","43: odor, smelling, fumes, smell, ventilation, smelled, smells, environmental, smoke, nostrils","odor, smelling, fumes, smell, ventilation, smelled, smells, environmental, smoke, nostrils",-0.9348772764205933

43,43,1l9riqc,Courthouse Station Smells Awful. Why?,"I've seen people complain about the smell of North Station, but nothing compares
to Courthouse from my experience.  This station uniquely always has a rancid
smell like that of vomit. It's horrible and I'm wondering if anyone has any
guesses why it does. I know there's issues to do with water leaking in the
station, maybe it has something to do with that?","43: odor, smelling, fumes, smell, ventilation, smelled, smells, environmental, smoke, nostrils","odor, smelling, fumes, smell, ventilation, smelled, smells, environmental, smoke, nostrils",-0.9164568781852722
43,43,1ad8npm,Re: Brookline Village D Line stoppage 1/28/24,"I was on the train that had to be disabled on the green line outbound around an
hour ago. There was a lot of electrical smoke and it smelled terrible. I now
have irritation in my lungs from (what I presume) inhaling this smoke, do I need
to get checked out by a doctor?","43: odor, smelling, fumes, smell, ventilation, smelled, smells, environmental, smoke, nostrils","odor, smelling, fumes, smell, ventilation, smelled, smells, environmental, smoke, nostrils",-0.8859632015228271

14,14,1nsufl5,Fitchburg Line Schedule Sucks!!!,"Barely any rush hour service, very infrequent off peak service, 2-3 trains
stopping at Silver Hill on weekdays only, and 2+ hour gaps aren't doing anyone
any good here! On top of that, this line is terrible with on time performance.
Whoever wrote out this schedule did a pretty bad job at it. Why does this exist
if the majority of the line is double tracked and the neighborhoods it serves
are quite dense???","14: fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule","fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule",-0.9286941289901733
14,14,1nkiuxq,Fitchburg line terrible today,"I was supposed to take 11 AM train in, which then got canceled mid route. The
next train is supposed to be an hour later but was a half an hour later than
that. Now I’m trying to go home, but I don’t see any trains coming. What the
heck is going on with this?  Who will take the rail when it works so poorly?","14: fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule","fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule",-0.9214603900909424

come to expect, but they really need to do a better job communicating it.","14: fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule","fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule",-0.8762422204017639
14,14,17rbhn1,Fitchburg Line Delays,"Anybody else notice an uptick in delays this fall?  Yesterday morning, the train
was almost an hour late.  Yesterday afternoon, the engine had a problem and we
had to switch trains.  This morning, something is wrong with the engine AGAIN,
and we have been at a standstill for 15 minutes with no update and no end in
sight.  These issues don’t seem all event related (like a storm / downed trees).
Is there some reason why it’s gotten so bad lately?  The Fitchburg line used to
be reliable…","14: fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule","fitchburg, delays, delayed, freight, track, lincoln, late, belmont, wednesdays, schedule",-0.8495684862136841

20,20,1eswcf3,Chatty passengers,"Bus drivers must get so annoyed when passengers stand right at the front talking
to them for miles and miles. It seems like a big distraction, first of all. It
also just seems so irritating. Most of the time drivers aren't responding
anyway, and people keep talking even when the plexiglass barrier is closed.
Sometimes it seems like they might actually know each other, or maybe the driver
is just chatty, but I just feel bad for them!","20: noise, beeping, squealing, passengers, annoying, ears, annoyed, yelling, squeal, loud","noise, beeping, squealing, passengers, annoying, ears, annoyed, yelling, squeal, loud",-0.8554889559745789

5:20. Now the 545 train isn’t here. Just unfortunate    Edit: 5:45 train just
arrived at 5:54 as I pulled off in the Uber haha, would be late anyways if I was

issues on this line or is there another issue that is really going on and using
mechanical issues as an excuse?  I understand having a bad day or two - it
happens.  However the delays and cancellations have become more commonplace.

they not even bother to look into fixing escalators anymore? For crying out loud

haven't been actively working on it since like November and it hurts the foot
traffic since you have to either fight your way down the stairs or up the
