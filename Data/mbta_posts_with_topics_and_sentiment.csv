Last week, [Deputy Transportation Secretary Steven Bradbury
hinted](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/28/metro/governor-healey-slams-trump-south-station-takeover/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)
that the federal government could take over Boston’s South Station as it did at
Union Station in Washington, D.C., citing crime and safety concerns.  But a
Globe analysis of police incident data and resident complaints shows that crime
at Boston’s bustling transit hub is relatively minimal, especially in contrast
to other major hubs like D.C.’s Union Station.  Transit Police statistics show
that there have so far been 22 violent or property crime incidents in 2025 at
the station, which is down 16 percent compared with data from the same time
period last year. Most of those incidents involved larceny.  Boston police,
meanwhile, logged four assault incidents by the close of August, the same number
as last year.  In either case, the volume of crime at South Station is largely
unremarkable, particularly compared with D.C.  While violent crime remains
minimal, resident complaints to the city’s 311 line show that some common
nuisances persist.  The most commonly reported issues involved stalled vehicles
and discarded needles. There were also 15 complaints about encampments in the
area since 2023.",24,"bostonglobe, jfk, trashing, incidents, ground, trash, south, crime, parades, rusted","24: bostonglobe, jfk, trashing, incidents, ground, trash, south, crime, parades, rusted","Feds eye South Station takeover over ‘crime.’ But crime there is actually low (Globe) [Link to Globe story

1mm0nlg,Stupid elevator smell QR code scheme. I’m mad.,"As a frequenter of this subreddit I don’t take kindly to T-bashing, assumptions
that problems could be easily remedied but MBTA staff are too lazy or stupid ,
don’t care etc - I’ve learned quite the opposite is usually true.  However I
would really like to know who approved this most ridiculous , feeble, incoherent
scheme to put the QR codes inside of these wretched, disgusting elevators ,
thinking that while holding their noses and bracing to jump out asap, that
riders would take the time to a) read a sign on the wall b) spend extra time to
take out their phone and scan the QR code to c) provide feedback voluntarily,
without direct incentive?! I would like to see how ma y people are completing
these surveys, how often, because I truly hope I’m wrong - seems like the
urination in elevators, like the city of Paris, has proved difficult to fix.
It’s almost every MBTA elevator I use in the system.   I’m livid because they’re
doing something about this, have come so close to a viable scheme , and yet it
didn’t dawn on anyone how stupid this is! T pays $21ish/hr to have Transit
Ambasaadors in station , and they’re required to do a “station check” every 20
mins and note issues on their tablets which are for sure internet connected .
The IG report in 2021 scorned the T for not ensuring BBB was doing this
contractual requirement, now they are, but I hope I’m wrong that I assume those
reports aren’t going right to the highly competent MCC Maintenance Control
Center which will deploy “the trades”  Via an organized service request system
that I’ve witnessed have facilities maintenance issues fixed within 24 hours
often. I suppose station cleaning is contracted out and not internal E&amp;M ,
but maybe MCC already sends service requests to contractors (?) because all
elevators are entirely handled by contractors.   Or they could have the
contracted crews who we see cleaning stations do an hourly check on this and
submit to their QR code system. Very easy. Or perhaps put the sign w the QR code
and elevator code on a pole a few feet away etc! I was in elevator 909 and I
didn’t get a chance to help solve this problem because I my willingness to help
has its limits.  I also wanted to mention that putting in complaints / comments
on the website is the originator source of many Engineering &amp; Maintenance
MCC service requests/ work orders! I will be pasting this text there next. There
are systems at the MBTA which operate effectively, much more so than I’d have
imagined before seeing this.   Also I think wetness sensors are possibly a
thing? Also there’s always inspectors and often CSR staff at substations , they

1lxrcnw,Where is best to submit a complaint about no more JFK/UMass Commuter Rail weekend service?,"I'm really upset about JFK/UMass service being fully cut from the weekend
Commuter Rail schedules for the Old Colony lines.   Taking the Red Line to
Braintree or South Station not only isn't reliable for catching your train on
time, but adds on almost an additional $5 to a round trip. Commuter Rail tickets
already aren't the cheapest and JFK/UMass serves many people in the area who
live in the Mary Ellen McCormack Project and in Columbia Point. This decision
physically and financially cuts off direct Commuter Rail access to low-income
communities. And in general, cuts off so many people from their closest Commuter
Rail access.   The train has to pass through JFK/UMass anyway and cutting it out
of the route doesn't even save significant time during weekend service. They
could have instead just made JFK/UMass a flag stop all weekend!  That being
said, would the best place to voice these concerns be by submitting a comment
for the MBTA Board meeting? Or is this something that the MBTA Rider Oversight
Committee would be a better candidate for? Or is submitting comments to both

meeting in Revere.  Then on the way back without notice they decided to only go
to Airport and shuttle the rest of the way. After sitting at Orient Heights for
15 min I decided to grab the next west bound bus, try to get to Maverick and
take the ferry.  I get on the 120 and tell the driver casually I’m using this
bus in lieu of the shuttle since I just need to get to Maverick.  He says ok but
you still have to pay.  No problem.  I paid.  When I sat back down I said out
loud (not directed to him) out of sheer frustration:  I shouldn’t have to pay
for alternate transportation when the main form of transportation is down for
repairs. Then he started calling me entitled and was ranting about blue collar
something or other.  There was no need for him to engage beyond asking me to pay
but he kept going on.  I then asked him for his ID number and man did that
trigger him.  He gave it, then said something about yeah go ahead and tweet
about it whatever.  I was not saying anything, not engaging him.  Then he says
out of the blue, you know what just get off my bus.  He’s a public employee.  He
did not have to engage me at all, but he was obviously looking for a fight.  I
already called customer service and filed a complaint. You don’t get to act like

firefighter.  My points:  my statement about how it’s kinda crappy we have to
pay for an alternate form when the primary is down was out of frustration of the

1i2em6u,66 bus -- Roxbury crossing &lt;-&gt; Brigham Circle,"I keep seeing periodic complaints about the 66. As a semi-regular rider on the
66 between Roxbury and Brookline, it seems to me that a \*major\* reason for the
issues is the small stretch between Roxbury Crossing and Brigham Circle on
Tremont St.  The first issue is crossing Columbus. Sometimes the bus takes 2
signals to cross Columbus to the OL station stop because the signal is
(relatively) short for the traffic, and, for whatever reason, the left turn into
Columbus from the OL station side of Tremont gets precedence. Also the
pedestrian crossing is 30 seconds. Transit priority + moving the pedestrian
crossing underground or overground should solve this issue -- and save 3-5
minutes. Given the recent tragic pedestirian accident in that intersection, the
latter should be a no-brainer for pedestrian safety as well.      The second
issue is Tremont St. Traffic there is single lane, but there's parking on both
sides. This stretch takes maybe 10 minutes on bad days for the half mile or so
between Brigham Circle and the station. The easy solution is to remove the
parking and convert to bus lane, or at the very least, ban parking during rush
hour, as on Washington St in Roslindale.  Is this something Boston can do
unilaterally? Is it worth raising with the Council?      (Another choke point
that I'm aware of is Coolidge Corner, but of course, that's in Brookline.)",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"66 bus -- Roxbury crossing &lt;-&gt; Brigham Circle I keep seeing periodic complaints about the 66. As a semi-regular rider on the

amount of posts that have focused on recent signal issues that has occurred at
Broadway and JFK/UMass.  While we appreciate all of the commentary that has
occurred regarding the MBTA’s need to repair the signal issue, many of these
posts would be better served by a comment thread, where questions can be asked
and answered easily, to avoid the subreddit being overburden by the same
question multiple times without any additional information/comments.   The main
issue with the signal is the fact they there are analog, meaning that they are
running on an outdated system and are easily impacted by the recent cold wave
that has happened in the Greater Boston area. This is probably why the signals
at Broadway and JFK/UMass are faulting. Sometimes, the internal working of the
signal may fail/not work, or it could be an issue with the system as a whole.
Trains use signals to know when a train is nearby or when they need to go at a
slower speed for safety reasons (i.e: slowzone, person on track, etc.), just
like you would while driving a car. If the signal malfunction, the train cannot
go at the full speed because of the possibility of an accident or derailment.
The MBTA is actively focusing on the entire signal system in 2025, with
shutdowns planned in areas where work is needed the most. The overhaul of the
signal should be done by early 2026, as the project is being accelerated by GM

station is receiving a fresh round of criticism from abutters, who claim the
construction is disrupting their lives and potentially damaging their
properties.  Their grievances were aired out at a meeting of the Ashmont-Adams
Neighborhood Association last Thursday at the Plasterer’s Union Hall on Minot
Street, where residents of Huron Circle, a circular side-street of about 25
homes off Gallivan Boulevard, were the most vocal participants.  They claim that
they were not properly engaged by MBTA planners and their contractors ahead of
the $116.6 million project, which has now been underway for about 18 months.
They say planners may have engaged with neighbors on other streets near the
facility, but did not do so with Circle residents.  The work, which includes the
noisy pounding of piles and other heavy work, is aimed at expanding the tracks
and other infrastructure inside Codman Yard, the storage and maintenance
facility at the Ashmont end of the Red Line branch.  “[The MBTA] did not include
our street on any construction map or do any outreach,” said one neighbor who
spoke at the meeting. “It was just waking up one morning to the sound of heavy
equipment and wondering what was going on. All of a sudden they are pounding,
digging up our street, and that’s not acceptable.”  “This has been going on
since October 2023 and I think I’m going to hire an attorney and try to stop
this, put a stop work order on Huron Circle,” said Alison McCormack, who also
lives there.  Roodly Dorleans, a project manager for the MBTA, was at the
meeting and countered the abutter’s claims, saying that pre-construction survey
letters were sent to six homes on Huron Circle. Only one responded, he said.
But other neighbors, saying they never received any communications about
construction, are worried that their home’s foundations might be impacted.
Huron Circle’s Lenny MacKoul, who has organized neighbors in an email chain,
said one major source of contention is the eastern side of the enclave, closest
to the MBTA tracks, where trees that provided a sight and sound buffer have been
removed. The prospect of those trees being replaced is not in question, but now
there’s a worry that there will be no greenery along the tracks, and instead
only stonework.  “We know it won’t look like it did, but it’s extremely
important we get that green space back and get some trees and get some
buffering,” said MacKoul.  His neighbor, McCormack, emphasized that point: “They
need to find it in the budget to address things on our street and what they are
doing to the trees here. We were never included in any of these plans.”  Other
complaints raised at the meeting included allegations of inattentiveness by the
State Police detail, lack of follow-through by the contractor, Barletta, not
baiting for rats, dust issues, and better project communication online.
Councillor John FitzGerald attended the meeting and said the MBTA needed to
address the issue immediately, particularly for folks worried about possible
damage to their homes.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"MBTA News | Residents near Codman Yard say that MBTA did not alert them of construction near Huron Circle,  Boston councilman Fitzgerald asking MBTA to address issue. (via Dorchester Reporter) A public works project to improve and expand an MBTA facility next to Ashmont
station is receiving a fresh round of criticism from abutters, who claim the
construction is disrupting their lives and potentially damaging their
properties.  Their grievances were aired out at a meeting of the Ashmont-Adams
Neighborhood Association last Thursday at the Plasterer’s Union Hall on Minot
Street, where residents of Huron Circle, a circular side-street of about 25
homes off Gallivan Boulevard, were the most vocal participants.  They claim that
they were not properly engaged by MBTA planners and their contractors ahead of
the $116.6 million project, which has now been underway for about 18 months.
They say planners may have engaged with neighbors on other streets near the
facility, but did not do so with Circle residents.  The work, which includes the
noisy pounding of piles and other heavy work, is aimed at expanding the tracks
and other infrastructure inside Codman Yard, the storage and maintenance
facility at the Ashmont end of the Red Line branch.  “[The MBTA] did not include

Ben Ewen-Campen brought forth a resolution at the July 11 council meeting,

advertising, unnecessarily burdening non-English speakers and people with

1dhnife,Proposed Changes to the Sub - Rules and Rant Thread - We want your feedback!,"starting off with the proposed rules.  # Purpose:  One of the main goals of our
expanded mod team was to come up with some rules for the sub, to ensure
continued civility and to encourage thoughtful discussion. Even though the sub
is currently doing (relatively) well right now without rules, this is Reddit
after all, and things can quickly deteriorate. As such, it is fit to institute a
set of rules now, while we can thoughtfully discuss such matters, rather than
rushing to implement rules if/when things go sour and emotions are high. Also,
us mods are enforcing some general concepts (be civil, no spam), but we want to
make sure that all users know the exact expectations through rules (and are
treated as equally as possible). Rules will also help to make enforcement more
even by giving us mods a concrete baseline on whether or not to take action,
instead of just feelings.  # The Proposed Rules:  **Rule 1: Be Civil.**  No
offensive, hateful, or otherwise unpleasant behavior toward individuals,
organizations, or groups of people.  **Explanation:**  This is the most
important rule on this list. One of the core things that makes  such a good
place is how (relative to some other subs) civil it is. The goal of this rule is
to make it even more clear that we will not tolerate any nastiness.
**Enforcement**:  Enforcement will depend on how bad the infraction is. If it is
very minor, then we will give a warning. If it is moderate-severe, then the
content will be removed. The most severe and repeated infractions could result
in a user ban, the length of which is at the moderator's discretion.  **Rule
2:**  All Content Must be MBTA or Boston area transit related. Any content about
other transit agencies/areas must relate to the MBTA/Boston area transit in some
way.  **Explanation:**  This is a sub about Boston-area public transportation,
specifically the MBTA. However, it can be important to use other agencies and
their policies for discussion purposes. This rule will even out current
enforcement while continuing to allow for things related to other agencies to
contribute to conversation.  **Enforcement:**  Either a warning or removal,
depending on content visibility, relevancy (if it's in a gray area, then we will
write a reminder in the comments), and frequency of offenses from that user.
**Rule 3.**  No Spam/Low Effort Posts. Posts that have no effort put into them
or don’t add to the conversation are subject to this rule.  **Explanation:**
This community strives to be one with high quality content and good
conversations. Low quality posts or posts that don't contribute have no need to
be here.  **Enforcement:**  Post Removal. If a user continually spams, then a
temporary or permanent ban will be administered.  **Rule 4**.  Flag NSFW posts.
Any posts that contain NSFW material must be marked as such.  **Explanation:**
This is not an NSFW community. Many of us don't want to see that kind of
content, so PLEASE flag it as such.  **Enforcement:**  Post removal, ban on user
if there are repeated infractions.  **Rule 5.**  No editorializing/opinionizing
News Articles in your post title. Don't make it seem like a news source is
saying something it isn't. You are fully allowed to include your opinions on the
news article or its contents within the text of your post (not the title) as
long as it's made clear that it's your opinion.  **Explanation:**  To quote  ,
this ""goes against the spirit of Reddit""  **Enforcement:**  If the case is
deemed minor, then a written warning will be given out. If the case is deemed
major, then the post will be removed. If there are repeated infractions, then a
user ban is on the table.  # Please Give Feedback  We want your feedback.
Implementing these rules would result in some changes to the sub, and we do not
want to do this without community input. We're looking for feedback on whether

that the MBTA can suck a lot, and there's LOTS of stuff to rant about. However,
it's really hard to facilitate this with just regular posts. Too many ranty
posts can clutter up the feed, and many will often get downvoted to smithereens.
This in turn causes people to feel that they really don't have a place to rant
about the T, and such a place IS very much needed.  By providing a dedicated
thread for ranting, we can both provide a better space for more ranting and make
more space for less ranty posts.  **How it would work**  The rant thread would
always be a pinned post, except for unusual circumstances where something
extremely important comes up. This post would be refreshed weekly, posting every
Sunday at 12AM. Within this thread, we would encourage people to support each
other while also sometimes giving some information about rant topics. Again,
this thread is a place for people to be able to rant without worrying about
being downvoted or ignored.  **Would I be required to post any ranting here?**
No. It would be completely optional as to whether or not to put your ranting in
this thread.  # Please Give Feedback  We want to know what you think about this
rant thread, anything you would change, and if you don't like the idea. Even if
you have no complaints/changes for the rant thread, please comment.  Thank you,

expanded mod team was to come up with some rules for the sub, to ensure
continued civility and to encourage thoughtful discussion. Even though the sub
is currently doing (relatively) well right now without rules, this is Reddit
after all, and things can quickly deteriorate. As such, it is fit to institute a
set of rules now, while we can thoughtfully discuss such matters, rather than
rushing to implement rules if/when things go sour and emotions are high. Also,
us mods are enforcing some general concepts (be civil, no spam), but we want to
make sure that all users know the exact expectations through rules (and are
treated as equally as possible). Rules will also help to make enforcement more
even by giving us mods a concrete baseline on whether or not to take action,
instead of just feelings.  # The Proposed Rules:  **Rule 1: Be Civil.**  No
offensive, hateful, or otherwise unpleasant behavior toward individuals,
organizations, or groups of people.  **Explanation:**  This is the most
important rule on this list. One of the core things that makes  such a good
place is how (relative to some other subs) civil it is. The goal of this rule is
to make it even more clear that we will not tolerate any nastiness.
**Enforcement**:  Enforcement will depend on how bad the infraction is. If it is
very minor, then we will give a warning. If it is moderate-severe, then the
content will be removed. The most severe and repeated infractions could result
in a user ban, the length of which is at the moderator's discretion.  **Rule
2:**  All Content Must be MBTA or Boston area transit related. Any content about
other transit agencies/areas must relate to the MBTA/Boston area transit in some
way.  **Explanation:**  This is a sub about Boston-area public transportation,
specifically the MBTA. However, it can be important to use other agencies and
their policies for discussion purposes. This rule will even out current
enforcement while continuing to allow for things related to other agencies to
contribute to conversation.  **Enforcement:**  Either a warning or removal,
depending on content visibility, relevancy (if it's in a gray area, then we will
write a reminder in the comments), and frequency of offenses from that user.
**Rule 3.**  No Spam/Low Effort Posts. Posts that have no effort put into them
or don’t add to the conversation are subject to this rule.  **Explanation:**
This community strives to be one with high quality content and good
conversations. Low quality posts or posts that don't contribute have no need to
be here.  **Enforcement:**  Post Removal. If a user continually spams, then a
temporary or permanent ban will be administered.  **Rule 4**.  Flag NSFW posts.
Any posts that contain NSFW material must be marked as such.  **Explanation:**
This is not an NSFW community. Many of us don't want to see that kind of
content, so PLEASE flag it as such.  **Enforcement:**  Post removal, ban on user
if there are repeated infractions.  **Rule 5.**  No editorializing/opinionizing
News Articles in your post title. Don't make it seem like a news source is
saying something it isn't. You are fully allowed to include your opinions on the
news article or its contents within the text of your post (not the title) as
long as it's made clear that it's your opinion.  **Explanation:**  To quote  ,
this ""goes against the spirit of Reddit""  **Enforcement:**  If the case is
deemed minor, then a written warning will be given out. If the case is deemed
major, then the post will be removed. If there are repeated infractions, then a
user ban is on the table.  # Please Give Feedback  We want your feedback.
Implementing these rules would result in some changes to the sub, and we do not
want to do this without community input. We're looking for feedback on whether
or not you like these rules, any additions/removals of rules you'd like to see,
any changes in proposed enforcement, etc. Even if you have no complaints/changes
and like the rules, please comment.  # Rant Thread  **Purpose:**  We all know

easier than changing their commute entirely. I’m lucky that my job is forgiving
during these shutdowns but that’s not the case for many. I’ll also specify that

been clean, comfortable and timely and drivers are very friendly and
professional.   I’m completely out of patience. We’ve been gritting our teeth

18t6l63,Vent and warning: Track assignments at Ruggles,"Over the past few months, I started taking the commuter rail to Ruggles for my
daily commute 2-3 times a week. The MBTA publishes track assignments on its
schedule and has digital signage with tracks and times in the station and on the
platforms, in addition to (spotty but present) automated announcements with this
information.   The problem is... these track assignments are consistently wrong!
Particularly in the afternoon/evening. Combined with digital signage on the
trains themselves that I estimate is not working maybe 40% of the time and the
fact that the trains are always slightly late and rarely arrive at the posted
time, this can cause confusion for people unfamiliar to the station.  The most
egregious problem is that inbound trains after the AM rush switch from Tracks
1/3 (then main island platform) to Track 2 (the side platform). But on the
schedule/signage/announcements for at least the inbound Needham and Forge Park
lines, it still has them on Track 3 all day. And it is not possible to sprint
from Track 3 to Track 2 once you see (without any warning) that the train is
coming on a different track. I have personally missed my train because of this,
and today was trying to help a couple other people who were totally confused by
the multiple incorrect track assignments that occur every single day (they also
missed their train).   Because Ruggles is 90% regular commuters, the
predictability of the complete wrongness of the track assignments has resulted
in most people know which ""wrong"" track to go to. But for the people unfamiliar
with the station or schedule, they're simply out of luck. I assume the track
assignments were correct at one time, but then when Track 2 was reopened the
schedule was never adjusted. This is not a hard fix!  I have submitted several
complaints to the MBTA which then go to Keolis about this issue. I get a generic
""sorry for the inconvenience"" form letter and I don't have much hope that anyone
at the MBTA or Keolis cares. My first complaint was in August and nothing has
changed. I don't miss my train anymore but I submit the complaints anyways
because I am trying to draw any attention whatsoever to the problem. There is a
vague statement in the email about a future attempt to improve signage but I'm
not sure how that helps commuters now.   I find this issue and response
emblematic of the casual incompetence of the agency, the contempt it has towards
its passengers, and the hostility it exhibits towards ""outsiders"" who don't
""just know"" how to navigate the system (a great characteristic for a system
trying to grow its ridership!).   If anyone else notices this or other similar
issues around the system, I would encourage you to submit complaints as well.
There is a link on the MBTA website and it takes about 5 minutes to fill out.
I'm not sure if anyone at the MBTA will ever notice or care, but at least
if/when there is ever any audit of this situation they can't claim they never
knew or were told about the situation. Deep down I just wish the MBTA wasn't the

“Something physical like a postcard is real. It’s in your hands. It’s hard to
ignore,” said Andrew Cohen, 30, who printed out the postcards last week and
distributed them at T stops Thursday. “Anybody can complain on Twitter, but with
a physical card that was given out in Boston, that a real person put pen to
paper to and dropped it in a mailbox — that means they feel strongly about
\[what’s going on\].”  Each postcard [includes the mailing
address](https://i.imgur.com/eENS1RT.jpg) for the MBTA and Governor Maura
Healey’s office, as well as a link to a site that helps residents [find the
contact information for their state
representative](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator).  The cards
are available in red, blue, green, and orange, to align with the MBTA train line
colors passengers ride most often, and include a message that says, “Dear MBTA,
You need to fix this. Build a better T.”  Those who send them in are encouraged
to write their own personalized messages about how the T has let them down,
before dropping them in a mailbox.  Cohen, for example, wrote about how his
commute from Randolph to Cambridge on the Red Line has now ballooned to an
hour-and-a-half each way.  “I just want it to underscore that people need this
service. It can’t be put off, or ignored, or postponed any longer,” Cohen said.
“We’re at this crisis point where it’s almost non-functional, so we want to keep
the fire under the people in charge to keep moving forward and take this
seriously.”  On Thursday, Cohen and Sebastian Luu, a 21-year-old Suffolk
University student, stood outside Downtown Crossing and Park Street stations and
handed out about 40 postcards passersby in under two hours.  The postcards
themselves were free. Cohen said he will accept donations from those willing and

120w93q,Why do the new Red and Orange Line cars beep so much?,"From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):  There have been so many problems with the
MBTA’s new Red and Orange Line cars — derailments, a battery explosion, loose
brake bolts, malfunctioning doors, disconnected wiring, years-long delays — that
weary riders have likely forgotten one of the long-awaited cars’ most criticized
features: The incessant, loud beeping sound they make when the doors are open.
Now — four years after the first new train began carrying passengers — the T is
retrofitting the fleet with a different, less frequent sound.  The change is the
result of testing last year with riders who are blind or visually impaired. The
sound is meant to guide riders to the doors and indicate that the doors are
still open.  The retrofitting began in January, said Laura Brelsford, the T’s
assistant general manager for systemwide accessibility. So far, 64 of the 82 new
Orange Line cars and all 12 of the new Red Line cars have the new sound, said T
spokesperson Joe Pesaturo.  The new sound aims to address concerns from the
general riding public — that the beeps are disruptive and too loud — without
sacrificing the benefits for riders who are blind or visually impaired,
Brelsford said.  “We had reason to believe that this was a new feature that was
going to take folks a while to get used to,” she said. “We really began looking
into it as complaints persisted.”  The beeping feature is a much-welcomed assist
for riders who are blind and visually impaired, said Reggie Ramos, director of
Inclusive Public Transit at the [Institute for Human Centered
Design](https://www.humancentereddesign.org/), the Boston firm contracted by the
T to test the feature.  Eleven riders reviewed their experiences using the new
Orange Line trains from October to December last year, Ramos said, and chose a
new chime from five options provided by the T. The group reported that the

11fddat,"Family of Robinson Lalin, man dragged to death by Red Line train, sues MBTA","From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):  The family of Robinson Lalin, the man who
was dragged to death by a Red Line train last April after his arm got stuck in
the car door, is suing the MBTA.  A complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court on
Wednesday by the Lalin family alleges his death was “caused by the carelessness
and negligence of the defendant MBTA,” including the train operator’s failure to
check that the doors were clear of passengers before moving forward, and the T’s
failure to “properly inspect, maintain, repair, and monitor the subway cars and
station,” according to the complaint.  One of Lalin’s two children, Christopher
Lalin, and his nephew, Kelvin Lalin, are named as plaintiffs. The family is
seeking an undisclosed amount of money and cites economic damages as a result of
Lalin’s death, including medical and funeral expenses, lost wages, and lost

he exited the train at Broadway Station around 12:30 a.m. on April 10 and

Lalin urged T riders to use caution, recalling his uncle’s tragic death.  “Our

be depended on,” he said. “The T issues are very serious and we must stand up

in our city.”  Lalin’s death was one in a long series of grave safety incidents
on the MBTA that spurred the Federal Transit Administration to take an increased
oversight role of the agency and conduct a nearly unprecedented federal safety
inspection last year. That inspection found that the T’s focus on long-term
projects had come at the expense of day-to-day operations and safety.  Federal

was dragged to death by a Red Line train last April after his arm got stuck in
the car door, is suing the MBTA.  A complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court on
Wednesday by the Lalin family alleges his death was “caused by the carelessness
and negligence of the defendant MBTA,” including the train operator’s failure to
check that the doors were clear of passengers before moving forward, and the T’s
failure to “properly inspect, maintain, repair, and monitor the subway cars and
station,” according to the complaint.  One of Lalin’s two children, Christopher
Lalin, and his nephew, Kelvin Lalin, are named as plaintiffs. The family is
seeking an undisclosed amount of money and cites economic damages as a result of
Lalin’s death, including medical and funeral expenses, lost wages, and lost
earning capacity.  A spokesperson for the MBTA did not immediately respond to a

face. At least Reddit can be cathartic outlet...  North Quincy red line
Braintree route on 2/22/23 at 345PM.  I buy a monthly pass, and when attempting
to swipe my card, the screen said, ""See attendant"", well lucky for me, no one is
there in the cubical. I swipe my card again, and now the screen says, ""Not
enough value."" Mind boggling as I have the monthly pass. Used it this AM no
problem in Braintree and confirmed by swiping card on the console and clear as
day says ""monthly pass - expires 2/28/2023"".   What am I to do, as the last cart
comes through for the next 28 minutes into the north quincy station? I have to
catch a commuter to middleborough for 425PM in Braintree. Do I hop the gate? Of
course not, that would be silly, my mum raised me better than that. What would
you do in my situation?   I've since taken a Lyft from the North Quincy station
to the Braintree station, because, like most people, I'd like to get home at a
decent hour after having taken the 550AM train from Middleborough.   The amount
of stress this situation has put on me is evident from my smart watch telling me
I need to breathe. AI on my wrist works better than the MBTA, but I digress.
So I'm left in this stressful conundrum. Missed my train, my card doesn't work,
no attendant is available, and I just want to go home after a long day at work.
Lyft to the rescue.  Again, another piece of AI that works better than the MBTA.
Once I'm at the braintree station, after a lovely ride from my driver, Jessica,
I swipe my card again to try it out. Would you believe me when I said it, I have
the same issue. Shocker!   Lucky for me, there is an attendant here in
Braintree. He swipes my card again, ""see attendant."" He swipes my card on the
console and confirms i have the monthly pass that expires 2/28/2023. He swipes
his card at the gate, waits, then swipes my card at the gate...alas! My misery
washes away at the sweet, sweet sound of the gate swinging open. If I think
back, I even had to wipe a single tear from my eye. THE RELIEF!!   Now here I
am, sitting on commuter rail en route home and without the stress and fear that
I miss my train again tomorrow AM. Aside from the stress and anxiety, I now am
out an additional 18.99$. If the MBTA would care to cover that and make me
whole, we can all put this behind us.   I look forward to hearing back from
someone where we can have a good laugh at the whole situation.   Cheers!  PS:

love the MBTA.

enjoy it, the MBTA really annoys me and their planning gets me riled up, so I'm
contemplating switching my program.  I've vented some of these ideas to friends,
co-workers, and bartenders who have seemed to be receptive, or just won't call
me crazy to my face.    Full Disclaimer:  I grew upon the North Shore and still
live there, but I currently work in central Mass., i.e. I drive to work every
day but attend school and spend much of my time in Boston.  I also lived abroad
for several years and have used the transit systems in Montreal, Toronto,
Denver, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and probably a
few others, which I draw some of my ideas from.  First, there needs to be a ring
line that circumvents the metro Boston area.  Boston is small in terms of area,
but its suburbs are sprawling. Therefore everything within I95 should be
considered an extension of Boston.  A line that travels from the North shore, to
the metro west, to the south shore would relieve car stress on I95 in the tech
corridor and more T rider traffic away from downtown.  Ideally from Salem,
following I95 through Woburn, Burlington, Waltham, and onwards to Brockton or
Plymouth.  Second, we therefore extend the blue line through Lynn and onwards to
Salem.  Show of hands, who really goes to greyhound tracks these days?  I
thought so.  Lynn is the 10th most populous city in MA, Salem is smaller but is
growing and has a great restaurant scene.   The commuter rail should cease to
exist within I95.  Thats right, extend all subway lines outward, so all commuter
rail lines terminate at Oak Grove, Anderson/Woburn, Alewife, then go express
into Boston.  That ensures commuter rail riders do not have to travel strictly
into North or South Stations before changing lines.  Riders in Chelsea or
Mattapan don't have to rely on the slow commuter rail for their transit.
Eliminate railway crossings as much as possible.  This would take a lot of money
invested in infrastructure, but I've seen it in action in Narita and Tokyo.  If
railway lines are uninterrupted, i.e. they don't cross roads, they can travel at
a higher rate of speed and cut down on commuter travel time.    Eliminate the
12:45 end of service.  This is more of a budgeting issue, but who hasn't been
reliant on the T and left a bar early or overpaid a taxi?   The service could be
cut back to 3 am and run every half hour.     Anyways, those are my rants, I'd
appreciate comments, ideas, more rants, complaints, or insightful opinions.",19,"transportation, travel, moving, nyc, la, city, railway, staying, dc, optimistic","19: transportation, travel, moving, nyc, la, city, railway, staying, dc, optimistic","Expansion Ideas or Lack of Planning?

1o3k3wv,How to handle mildly combative people on the T,"Hi all. I just moved to Boston and have never lived anywhere near a city before.
Was riding the red line the other day and a man entered the train car. He kind
of stood in the middle of the car looking at the seated people awkwardly, and I
noticed that if I shifted seats I could make room for him to sit down, so I did.
As I did so, I made eye contact with him, smiled, and gestured toward the space
that opened up. He kind of like laughed at me and then sat down. He kept staring
at me for a bit, and began ranting incoherently. As time went on, he began
pointing at me repeatedly and saying ""this guy is a fucking motherfuck"" or
something that didn't make sense to me. I was trying not to make eye contact,
and when he got louder I stood up and moved slightly. He kept pointing at me and
started shouting ""GET OUT!"" and looking around saying ""this guy"" while pointing
at me. I just tried to avoid eye contact and eventually exited at my stop
without any further event. I know to more seasoned city dwellers this might be a
common occurrence and nothing to worry about, but I was just hoping to hear if
there is anything I can do to avoid drawing attention to myself like that, and
generally what tips y'all have to stay safe on the T since it had me kinda
spooked.",10,"assaulted, harassing, passenger, situation, police, violence, unsafe, elevator, yelling, what","10: assaulted, harassing, passenger, situation, police, violence, unsafe, elevator, yelling, what","How to handle mildly combative people on the T Hi all.

1kg21ur,4 car nightmare - the RL needs a good slap,"Second time for me this morning, getting a 4 car Red line train.   I thought
they were supposed to do that 'off hours' only, but apparently rush hour is also
fair game.  No matter how much they announce beforehand, half the people don't
move before the train arrives, so the  last car gets sardine-packed.   Then the
dwell time increases as the doors are held for people to move to the 3rd or 2nd
car to try to find space.    To top it off, the trains always stop at the
forward end of the station no matter what, rather than stopping 'where the

1idm3ha,Poor headway management still (venting),"I take the orange line daily. They've done a great job with headways at rush
hour. This post is anger about me running late in the context of a system that

min after missing a train. There's absolutely no published delays, but if 6 min
headways are the norm and a train is waiting 12 instead of 6 there should be a
delay.   After my train it looks like the headways are fixed, with 6 min
intervals. If there was a minor issue earlier or a dropped trip and you want to
hold my train to accomplish that, hold mine for 8, then the next for 6-8, etc.
Until you get back on. Now there's a random 6 min extra gap in the system
instead of 2-3.   All that being said, I know us orange line riders have way
more to be thankful for and seem to be experiencing less pain than the red line

1bmlig2,Greater Boston’s “slackivism” about the T: a discussion on how to improve the T.,"I made a post about this on the r/Boston subreddit, but I think making the same
post here will be better.  When I look at the T as a new resident of the city, I
realize that there is a big issue when it comes to advocacy for the T. A lot of
people complain about the T, which should be allowed and even encouraged,
especially at the state the T is in. However, I think that many Bostonians are
not complaining with nuance. What I mean by this is that I see too many people
complaining how the T is very slow or falling apart. I don’t see a lot of
conversation about how the state allowed the T to be in the situation it is in
by doing a forward funding system in 2000, basically causing the T to fund
itself through sales taxes that did not rise with inflation or increasing prices
for resources and upkeeping. Or how the federal government is not doing enough
to either take control of the T or force the state to do more to keep the system
running.   While we have organization such as TransitMatters and SteetsBlog Mass
are trying to build the connection between citizens and the state, it seems like
legislators are not doing enough to proactively respond to this at all levels,
aside from the task force, which will not respond until December. That does not
help the fact that the T is facing a $600 million dollar deficit starting in
July for the next fiscal year.   Bostonians needs to engage with their
politicians more instead of expecting the state to do something about the T. The
state legislators clearly do not care about funding the biggest transit system
in Massachusetts, or how not doing so and letting the T fail will cause millions
of people to potentially lose their jobs or access to very needed resources,
cause a major increase in traffic, and may even cause many to leave Boston
entirely. If they don’t seem to care, we should make sure that they know that we
know that they are not doing enough every day until they do something.   We need
to turn up at meetings with the T, turn up to City Council meetings to advocate
for more bus lanes, turn up to the State House to protest against the state’s
horrible policies for public transportation, and support the workers who are
working long hours to keep Boston running.  I want to hear your opinions about

15qqpc9,The Transit Situation around Here Makes Living a 15-Minute Journey from Work Impossible,"Title says it all. As a student, the situation is just depressing. I live in
Somerville and work in Kendall. I moved to my current apartment a year ago
largely thanks to its proximity to the red line. However, recently, between
walking to the station, waiting up to \~12 minutes for a train - even at peak
hours - then absolutely *crawling* down to Kendall and walking to work, a
15-minute car ride takes up to about 50 minutes to complete by T (and that's if
the trains are even operational, and not delayed down at Central for 25
minutes).     So, usually I bike, and it takes me under 20 minutes to get to
work. No problem (except getting hit by a car once, but no major injuries, so I
continue to bike because - hey - this is Boston, and that's just how it is).
Well, last week, during that huge road resurfacing period down near Inman, the
city of Cambridge left a **huge** stretch of road completely unpaved for days
with no obvious indicator of when it would end (literally a giant stretch from
Inman almost all the way to Kendall). Since I stupidly assumed that the
construction wouldn't last so many days, I kept biking that route, and lo and
behold my brand new front tire popped mid-week. (Brand new because my original
bike was freaking stolen while locked up outside work two months back).     Now,
to get to my usual bike shop, I usually - you guessed it - *bike*. You know
what's not at all conveniently accessible by the T, since you have to take the
green line (which doesn't allow bikes) to get there? The bike shop!!      So
now, sometime this week, I have to scrounge up the money to rent a Zipcar and
get my tire replaced. Then go through the whole ordeal of actually getting the
tire replaced. And in the meantime, I'll have to lose an hour of my life every
single day to the extra time it takes to get to and from work on the T.     As a
student in the Boston area, this is just depressing. It feels like at every
single turn, everyone in charge of any kind of transit is actively trying to
screw you over. Terrible T? Fine, I'll bike. Road work needs to be done? Fine,
I'll bike whatever unpaved route they allow. Tire popped? Great, now I have to
figure out how to pay for that *plus* at least a week on the T, which doesn't
deserve nearly the $22 it takes to get a week pass.      Anyway, this is just an
unproductive, anonymous rant online, but living here feels impossible at best
and downright adversarial at worst. Looking at my popped bike tire, I just don't
know what to do with myself other than cross my fingers and hope that I can move
far far away after I finish school here.      **tl;dr** I do everything I can to
avoid the red line and get on with my life, since transit is so tough here, and
even that isn't an option when the city doesn't care about bikers.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"The Transit Situation around Here Makes Living a 15-Minute Journey from Work Impossible Title says it all. As a student, the situation is just depressing. I live in

continue to bike because - hey - this is Boston, and that's just how it is).
Well, last week, during that huge road resurfacing period down near Inman, the
city of Cambridge left a **huge** stretch of road completely unpaved for days
with no obvious indicator of when it would end (literally a giant stretch from
Inman almost all the way to Kendall). Since I stupidly assumed that the
construction wouldn't last so many days, I kept biking that route, and lo and
behold my brand new front tire popped mid-week. (Brand new because my original
bike was freaking stolen while locked up outside work two months back).     Now,
to get to my usual bike shop, I usually - you guessed it - *bike*. You know
what's not at all conveniently accessible by the T, since you have to take the
green line (which doesn't allow bikes) to get there? The bike shop!!      So
now, sometime this week, I have to scrounge up the money to rent a Zipcar and
get my tire replaced. Then go through the whole ordeal of actually getting the
tire replaced. And in the meantime, I'll have to lose an hour of my life every
single day to the extra time it takes to get to and from work on the T.     As a
student in the Boston area, this is just depressing. It feels like at every
single turn, everyone in charge of any kind of transit is actively trying to
screw you over. Terrible T? Fine, I'll bike. Road work needs to be done? Fine,
I'll bike whatever unpaved route they allow. Tire popped? Great, now I have to
figure out how to pay for that *plus* at least a week on the T, which doesn't
deserve nearly the $22 it takes to get a week pass.      Anyway, this is just an
unproductive, anonymous rant online, but living here feels impossible at best
and downright adversarial at worst. Looking at my popped bike tire, I just don't
know what to do with myself other than cross my fingers and hope that I can move
far far away after I finish school here.      **tl;dr** I do everything I can to
avoid the red line and get on with my life, since transit is so tough here, and
even that isn't an option when the city doesn't care about bikers.",0.6481464505195618,0.32946470379829407,0.02238885499536991,-0.6257575750350952

we can’t double track the entirety of the line, especially in the Quincy

man (who I later found out is 16) boarded the train. He was smoking a blunt, as
a weed smoker I fully understand the frustration with public consumption and
agree in situations like this it is out of hand but this is not how to handle
it. We pull thru Wollaston, no issue, we get to North Quincy. Two men board the
train separately at this stop. One of the men asks the young man to put his
blunt back. He responds in a disrespectful manner and continues smoking. The man
goes to the end of the car and hits the emergency intercom (at this point I also
put in a See,Say report). He has a brief conversation with the conductor and
then we resume moving. Before we can even get to the neponset bridge a second
man walks up to the teen, yells at him to stop smoking and before the teen can
react the man picks him up and SLAMS him into the wall twice, he then throws him
to the ground and stays on top of him until we get to JFK. The man who used the
intercom then goes over to back up the man holding the teen down. Myself and
several other passengers immediately yelled at the man to stop what he was
doing. During this the teen disclosed he was 16 and the man STILL did not get
off of him. When we pulled into the station a single transit cop was left to
handle two men and a teen. All three were detained and our train moved on into

1iyzjer,Ridership Trends with Bus Network Redesign Routes,"Since the topic of bus route ridership came up, I decided to take a look at
TransitMatters' Covid Recovery Dashboard (link:
[https://recovery.transitmatters.org/](https://recovery.transitmatters.org/) )
to see how the Bus Network Redesign (BNRD) Phase 1 routes have been doing
ridership-wise since the changes. Overall, the data trends are interesting but
generally positive and paint a good picture of how the new routes have been
doing.  First, **Route 86**, which was cut back to Harvard Square Station, had a
predictable drop in ridership. It lost about 2,000 daily riders, or about 15
riders per trip, in ridership, from 5,547 weekday riders per day on 12/17/2024
to 3,392 riders per day as of 2/3/2025 (I'll get into the weird inconsistencies
in data reporting through this dashboard later). Interestingly, the route had a
marginal increase in service, particularly at midday on weekdays, and all around
on Sundays (increased service was advertised, but not particularly when that
would be). Next, let's look at route 109 to see how that route's extension in
place of the 86 affected its ridership.  **Route 109** did indeed pick up Route
86's ridership, and more. The route nearly doubled in ridership, gaining over
3,000 new riders, and going from 3,224 riders per day as of 12/4/2024 to 7,596
riders as of 1/26/2025. This jump is interesting because it suggests that Route
109 not only gained Route 86's former Sullivan Square - Harvard Square ridership
but gained an added approximately 1,000 riders per day. There are three factors
that could have caused this:  * New connection created: the transfer ridership
between routes 104 and 109 and routes between Union Square and Sullivan Square
was anecdotally quite significant (the MBTA doesn't track this to my knowledge),
and even marginal through-riding ridership helps numbers.  * BNRD service
reconfigurations: again anecdotally, transfers between BNRD routes, particularly
in Everett Square with Routes 104 and 110, have been significant, especially
with Route 109 essentially taking the entire Sullivan Square to Everett Square
ridership of the 104. This factor is likely to subside somewhat as people adjust
to the new routes, as much of these transfers were those travelling from Ferry
Street on Route 104 to Sullivan Square and are largely already within walking
distance to Route 109 or to the Orange Line (or will simply choose to take Route
104 to the Orange Line).  * Service boost: The number of 109 trips more than
doubled with the BNRD from 48 to 98.5 weekday roundtrips. An interesting fact I
found in researching this is that the BNRD incidentally made Route 109 the most
frequent bus connection between Linden Square and the Orange Line, beating the
schedule-coordinated trunk of Routes 108, 411, and 430 to Malden Center by a
whopping 21 roundtrips (combined the three routes have 71 weekday trips). This
is likely the largest factor, but by far not the only one.  **Route 104**'s
ridership was practically unchanged with the BNRD, at least as of 1/26/2025.
However, this route will likely have the longest time between implementation and
adjustments in ridership pattern with the large changes to the route being made,
so looking back in a few months will likely be of far more use. Anecdotally,
ridership between Everett Square and Airport is very low, and some advertising
of its utility, particularly in its connections to the Mystic Mall, and quicker
connection between Chelsea and the Blue Line, would likely go a long way in
improving ridership.  **Route 110** may be the most direct proof the MBTA can
get that increasing bus service increases ridership, as its ridership has gone
up strongly with the BNRD, without any changes to the route or its connections.
Ridership jumped up 1,000 weekday riders per day from 3,005 as of 12/9/2024 to
4,266 as of 1/26/2025. This complements its more than 60% increase in service,
meaning that the route has likely been able to absorb the additional ridership
well.  Finally, **Route 116**'s ridership has interestingly seemed to drop
slightly. However, it appears that Wonderland - Maverick ridership was
decreasing in line with the current trend far before the BNRD. Part of this may
be because of poor service reliability, as particularly during rush hours trips,
even post-BNRD, buses tend to get stuck in traffic and bunch up, leading to
service that does not adequately service the route’s large market in a way
similar to Route 1.  Overall, the very preliminary data that we have suggests
that the Bus Network Redesign has met its goal in increasing service and bus
ridership. However, as previously mentioned, the data provided by
TransitMatters, which comes directly from the MBTA, isn't particularly
high-quality or recent, especially on smaller periods like examined here. A
review of these routes' ridership trends will likely yield far better data on
the success of the routes and be far better able to account for adjustments in
ridership patterns with the new routes. Additionally, examining the many bus
routes that connect to BNRD routes, which all did not change significantly,
would be of interest to study the effects that the BNRD could have on the
broader MBTA system.  Having taken all the BNRD routes myself, changes were
certainly needed, and from riding routes I could tell that despite there being
some frustration with the changes in the short term, there was optimism amongst
riders that things would be better. However, much of the promise of the BNRD
requires the MBTA to not fall into previous pitfalls seen on already frequent
buses, and active measures to avoid them, which I personally felt are not
present with Phase 1 routes and certainly add to riders' frustrations. If people
can rely on the bus to come under every 15 minutes, as this data hopefully shows
to some extent, they will take it, and much of the work the MBTA needs to do
isn't simply on having a bus there, but people being able to rely on it.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"Ridership Trends with Bus Network Redesign Routes Since the topic of bus route ridership came up, I decided to take a look at

the bus took a left turn and ran him over, according to attorney Thomas Flaws of
Altman Nussbaum Shunnarah trial attorneys.  * From what we’ve seen, the turn
that the bus made into the crosswalk with a pedestrian in that crosswalk is a
violation of Massachusetts law, and we need to hold the MBTA responsible for
that,” Flaws said at a press conference in Boston Thursday.  * In an email
statement to Boston.com, the MBTA said it is “cooperating with the District
Attorney’s active investigation into the circumstances surrounding this
incident. Following safety-related incidents, it is standard procedure for
bus/train operators to be removed from service while the investigative process
advances,” the spokesperson wrote. “We send our condolences to the Inghram
family during this time.”  * Inghram was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center where he succumbed to his injuries.  * No charges have been filed in
Inghram's death.  * Nearby residents also wrote an open letter to the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Boston Public Works, Boston’s Chief
of Streets, and the MBTA, following Inghram’s death, asking for the agencies to
address safety concerns.  * The letter, signed by 695 Jamaica Plain, Forest

infrastructure” be addressed with “greater haste” and expresses residents’
frustration with the continued postponements of community outreach meetings
scheduled prior to the incident.  * Among those are a call to change the timing
of a walk signal, which currently goes green at the same time buses get a green
light to enter the intersection from the station, so that all vehicles have a
red light while pedestrians are in the crosswalk. Other suggested changes
include removing shrubbery that obstructs visibility, installing an additional
stoplight and curb extensions, and other improvements.  * Asked about the case

1fu19bv,"MBTA BREAKING NEWS | No Green Line service between North Station, Union Square, and Medford/Tufts until further notice after a major derailment of a Type 8 car near Lechmere.","**INITIAL REPORT: 6:30 PM, OCTOBER 1st, 2024**  The derailment happened at 10
Morgan Ave. shortly after 5 p.m.   Reports states that the Type 8 train may have
rode over a switch and was promptly derailed off of the tracks.  A passenger on
board who was heading home from work told Newscenter5 that it felt like the
train jolted forward and then back as the train derailed. The passenger also
says that one woman appeared to have been thrown forward and looked to have
scrapes on her hands and arms.  Several people were being evaluated for
non-life-threatening injuries, according to an X post from the Cambridge Fire
Department.  Cambridge Fire says that they are working to disable the overhead
catenary power to the train, however all passengers have been removed and are
being evaluated.  The DPU and FTA are being notified of the derailment with
further investigation by the FTA and MBTA to be done soon to determine the
extract reason for the derailment.  This will be the 3rd major vehicle
derailment this year after a Red Line train derailed at Broadway and a Green
Line train derailed at Kenmore.   **UPDATE AT 7:12 PM**  —via CBS Boston—  * The
derailment happened on the eastbound tracks at the Red Bridge.  * Approximately
50 riders evacuated themselves onto the tracks and walked to an emergency exit.
* The cause of the derailment is under investigation. The tracks are being
assessed for damaged as crews work to re-rail the train.    * Six injuries were
reported, but seven people were taken to medical facilities for treatment.   *
As of 5:49 p.m. on Tuesday, the department said firefighters were removing
electrical power from the derailed train.  * ""The MBTA sincerely apologizes to
riders for the frustration and distress this incident has caused,"" the MBTA said
in a statement. ""We are committed to thoroughly investigating this matter to
ensure this does not happen again.""  **UPDATE AT 7:19 PM**  —via Cambridge Day
and Green Line rider Aaron Berkowitz, who was in the train at the time of
derailment—  * We were just moving along when there was a thud, like a normal
thud – but then it kept going,” Berkowitz said. As the train left the rails and
hit gravel, and movement got rougher, “I grabbed the rail to keep myself from
bouncing around.” Smoke began to fill the car, though it was brief.  * The
roughly 30 riders got off and “for a while we were kind of milling around,”
Berkowitz said. As be began to walk back toward Lechmere station, MBTA workers
showed up to redirect riders to a back road away from tracks. Firefighters and
police also arrived.  * The conductor was heard saying the steering failed. “I
heard her saying ‘it wouldn’t turn right.’ It was at a point where the track
splits,” Berkowitz said.  * A photo by rider Aaron Berkowitz, who was heading
toward his home by Union Square, shows the green line train running off the
rails and knocking down equipment. No one appeared injured, Berkowitz said, and
the incident was “not as violent as one would expect from the phrase ‘train
derailment.’”  **UPDATE AT 7:33 PM**  —via NBC Boston—  * The MBTA says at about
5 p.m., the wheels of the lead trolley of a Green Line train were reported to
have come off the tracks, causing the train to derail near Lechmere Station
eastbound at the Red Bridge. Around 50 passengers self-evacuated onto the
tracks, where they had to walk back to an emergency exit located in the track
area.  * The MBTA said work crews were also responding to investigate, assess
any damage, and re-rail the train.  * The root cause of Tuesday's derailment
wasn't immediately known and is under investigation.  * The Department of Public
Utilities and the Federal Transit Administration have been notified.  **UPDATE
AT 8:25 PM**  —via NBC Boston—  * **MBTA Chief Operating Officer Ryan Coholan
will be holding a press conference at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in front of the main
entrance of Lechmere Station to address the Green Line incident. You can watch
it on NBC Boston.**  **UPDATE AT 8:44 PM**  **MAJOR NOTES FROM THE PRESS
CONFERENCE:**  •       ⁠The MBTA has determined that the track was not the
reason for the train derailing.  •       ⁠The T is now looking into human
factors that could have caused the derailments. (i.e: the operator of the train
may have not followed proper operating procedures)  •       ⁠The T has stated
that service on the Green Line Extension should resume by tomorrow morning.  •
⁠The T will take the train to a nearby repair facility for further
investigations into the train.  * The MBTA is now working on rerailing the train
and conducting their investigation into the cause of the derailment.   * The
train derailed near the Red Bridge Interlocking, where the Medford/Tufts and
Union Square branches meet near Lechmere.   * Any track that was damaged will
need to be repaired before service resumes.   **UPDATE AT 9:41 PM**  —via NBC
Boston—  * Coholan initially said at his press conference that he anticipated
regular service to resume Wednesday morning, saying that following re-railing,
they would thoroughly inspect the tracks again and then the vehicle would go to
one of their maintenance facilities for a thorough investigation. However, after
the press conference ended, MBTA officials were informed that the National
Transportation Safety Board is getting involved with the investigation, which
would halt the MBTA's efforts to clear up the tracks.   * The tracks will most
likely be closed Wednesday, Coholan later said.  * Shuttles are still in place
until further notice between North Station, Union Square, and Medford/Tufts.
Assuming that service does not resume Wednesday, your best chance for service
will be heading to Kendall/MIT or Central on the Red Line, Community College or
Sullivan on the Orange Line, using local buses, or West Medford on the Lowell
Commuter Rail line.  **UPDATE AT 10:38 PM**  —via Boston Globe—  * Late Tuesday
night, MBTA officials announced that investigators from the National
Transportation Safety Board were en route to the scene, and the T’s
investigation had to stop until they arrived.  * A spokesperson for the NTSB
said in an email to the Globe that the federal agency had been informed of the
derailment and was “gathering information,” but inspectors had not yet
responded.  **UPDATE AT 6:16 AM, OCTOBER 2ND, 2024**   —via NBC Boston—  * The
MBTA has continued shuttling passengers between North Station, Union Square, and
Medford/Tufts after the NTSB forced the MBTA to stop all repairs/investigations
so that the agency can conduct their own investigation.  * The derailed train
remains derailed on the elevated track, and the National Transportation Safety
Board is now running the investigation.  **UPDATE AT 10:24 AM**  —via South
Coast Today—  * A MBTA spokesperson said in a statement to the USA Today Network
that ""an estimate for restoring service is still being developed"" but the agency
will provide updates when more information is available.  * The NTSB
investigation is expected to begin Wednesday, a spokesperson said in a statement
to the USA Today Network. ""A team of NTSB investigators are expected to be on
scene today,"" a NTSB spokesperson said. ""Once on site, the investigator will
begin the process of documenting the scene and examining the train cars and
equipment involved.""  **UPDATE AT 10:46 AM**  —via Boston Globe—  * Federal
investigators are expected to soon begin documenting the scene of Tuesday’s
Green Line derailment in Cambridge, examining the train cars and equipment
involved, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said.   *
During the investigation, the agency will not speculate about the cause of the
accident.  * Based on initial reports, “there does not appear to be any impact
to foreign objects or other equipment,” the National Transportation Safety Board
said in an emailed statement, but noted that the derailment remains under
investigation.  * There was no immediate timetable for when normal train service
will resume.  * The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigation
involveslooking at the “human, machine, and the operating environment.”  *
Investigators will gather a number of records and information, including image
and event recorders from the locomotive, track maintenance and inspection
records, signal data, witness statements, and a 72-hour background of the crew
to determine “if there were any issues that could have affected the
operator/engineer’s ability to safety operate the train,” the agency said.  *
Witnesses to the derailment are asked to contact the agency.  * A preliminary
report will be available within 30 days, while a final report, which will detail
the probable cause of the crash and any contributing factors, is expected to be
released between one and two years from now, the federal agency said.   **UPDATE
AT 11:23 AM**  —via MBTA—  **GM ENG’s STATEMENT REGARDING DERAILMENT**  “We
apologize for this unfortunate incident, to the riders who were aboard this
Green Line trolley yesterday, and to riders who continue to be disrupted by the
shut down,” said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng. “Safety continues to
be our top priority and this incident is unacceptable. We’re working alongside
our federal and state partners to understand what happened to make sure this
doesn’t happen again. We know this unplanned service change is a challenge, and
we thank our riders for their patience at this time.”   **MBTA’s STATEMENT
REGARDING DERAILMENT**  The MBTA and its regulatory partners are investigating
this incident. Once the investigation is complete and the area is returned to
the T, infrastructure and maintenance personnel will make all repairs necessary
to restore service.  The MBTA is working collaboratively with the National

Morgan Ave. shortly after 5 p.m.   Reports states that the Type 8 train may have
rode over a switch and was promptly derailed off of the tracks.  A passenger on
board who was heading home from work told Newscenter5 that it felt like the
train jolted forward and then back as the train derailed. The passenger also
says that one woman appeared to have been thrown forward and looked to have
scrapes on her hands and arms.  Several people were being evaluated for
non-life-threatening injuries, according to an X post from the Cambridge Fire
Department.  Cambridge Fire says that they are working to disable the overhead
catenary power to the train, however all passengers have been removed and are
being evaluated.  The DPU and FTA are being notified of the derailment with
further investigation by the FTA and MBTA to be done soon to determine the
extract reason for the derailment.  This will be the 3rd major vehicle
derailment this year after a Red Line train derailed at Broadway and a Green
Line train derailed at Kenmore.   **UPDATE AT 7:12 PM**  —via CBS Boston—  * The
derailment happened on the eastbound tracks at the Red Bridge.  * Approximately
50 riders evacuated themselves onto the tracks and walked to an emergency exit.
* The cause of the derailment is under investigation. The tracks are being
assessed for damaged as crews work to re-rail the train.    * Six injuries were
reported, but seven people were taken to medical facilities for treatment.   *
As of 5:49 p.m. on Tuesday, the department said firefighters were removing
electrical power from the derailed train.  * ""The MBTA sincerely apologizes to
riders for the frustration and distress this incident has caused,"" the MBTA said
in a statement. ""We are committed to thoroughly investigating this matter to
ensure this does not happen again.""  **UPDATE AT 7:19 PM**  —via Cambridge Day
and Green Line rider Aaron Berkowitz, who was in the train at the time of
derailment—  * We were just moving along when there was a thud, like a normal
thud – but then it kept going,” Berkowitz said. As the train left the rails and
hit gravel, and movement got rougher, “I grabbed the rail to keep myself from
bouncing around.” Smoke began to fill the car, though it was brief.  * The
roughly 30 riders got off and “for a while we were kind of milling around,”
Berkowitz said. As be began to walk back toward Lechmere station, MBTA workers
showed up to redirect riders to a back road away from tracks. Firefighters and
police also arrived.  * The conductor was heard saying the steering failed. “I
heard her saying ‘it wouldn’t turn right.’ It was at a point where the track
splits,” Berkowitz said.  * A photo by rider Aaron Berkowitz, who was heading
toward his home by Union Square, shows the green line train running off the
rails and knocking down equipment. No one appeared injured, Berkowitz said, and
the incident was “not as violent as one would expect from the phrase ‘train
derailment.’”  **UPDATE AT 7:33 PM**  —via NBC Boston—  * The MBTA says at about
5 p.m., the wheels of the lead trolley of a Green Line train were reported to
have come off the tracks, causing the train to derail near Lechmere Station
eastbound at the Red Bridge. Around 50 passengers self-evacuated onto the
tracks, where they had to walk back to an emergency exit located in the track
area.  * The MBTA said work crews were also responding to investigate, assess
any damage, and re-rail the train.  * The root cause of Tuesday's derailment
wasn't immediately known and is under investigation.  * The Department of Public
Utilities and the Federal Transit Administration have been notified.  **UPDATE
AT 8:25 PM**  —via NBC Boston—  * **MBTA Chief Operating Officer Ryan Coholan
will be holding a press conference at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in front of the main
entrance of Lechmere Station to address the Green Line incident. You can watch
it on NBC Boston.**  **UPDATE AT 8:44 PM**  **MAJOR NOTES FROM THE PRESS
CONFERENCE:**  •       ⁠The MBTA has determined that the track was not the
reason for the train derailing.  •       ⁠The T is now looking into human
factors that could have caused the derailments. (i.e: the operator of the train
may have not followed proper operating procedures)  •       ⁠The T has stated
that service on the Green Line Extension should resume by tomorrow morning.  •
⁠The T will take the train to a nearby repair facility for further
investigations into the train.  * The MBTA is now working on rerailing the train
and conducting their investigation into the cause of the derailment.   * The
train derailed near the Red Bridge Interlocking, where the Medford/Tufts and
Union Square branches meet near Lechmere.   * Any track that was damaged will
need to be repaired before service resumes.   **UPDATE AT 9:41 PM**  —via NBC
Boston—  * Coholan initially said at his press conference that he anticipated
regular service to resume Wednesday morning, saying that following re-railing,
they would thoroughly inspect the tracks again and then the vehicle would go to
one of their maintenance facilities for a thorough investigation. However, after
the press conference ended, MBTA officials were informed that the National
Transportation Safety Board is getting involved with the investigation, which
would halt the MBTA's efforts to clear up the tracks.   * The tracks will most
likely be closed Wednesday, Coholan later said.  * Shuttles are still in place
until further notice between North Station, Union Square, and Medford/Tufts.
Assuming that service does not resume Wednesday, your best chance for service
will be heading to Kendall/MIT or Central on the Red Line, Community College or
Sullivan on the Orange Line, using local buses, or West Medford on the Lowell
Commuter Rail line.  **UPDATE AT 10:38 PM**  —via Boston Globe—  * Late Tuesday
night, MBTA officials announced that investigators from the National
Transportation Safety Board were en route to the scene, and the T’s
investigation had to stop until they arrived.  * A spokesperson for the NTSB
said in an email to the Globe that the federal agency had been informed of the
derailment and was “gathering information,” but inspectors had not yet
responded.  **UPDATE AT 6:16 AM, OCTOBER 2ND, 2024**   —via NBC Boston—  * The
MBTA has continued shuttling passengers between North Station, Union Square, and
Medford/Tufts after the NTSB forced the MBTA to stop all repairs/investigations
so that the agency can conduct their own investigation.  * The derailed train
remains derailed on the elevated track, and the National Transportation Safety
Board is now running the investigation.  **UPDATE AT 10:24 AM**  —via South
Coast Today—  * A MBTA spokesperson said in a statement to the USA Today Network
that ""an estimate for restoring service is still being developed"" but the agency
will provide updates when more information is available.  * The NTSB
investigation is expected to begin Wednesday, a spokesperson said in a statement
to the USA Today Network. ""A team of NTSB investigators are expected to be on
scene today,"" a NTSB spokesperson said. ""Once on site, the investigator will
begin the process of documenting the scene and examining the train cars and
equipment involved.""  **UPDATE AT 10:46 AM**  —via Boston Globe—  * Federal
investigators are expected to soon begin documenting the scene of Tuesday’s
Green Line derailment in Cambridge, examining the train cars and equipment
involved, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said.   *
During the investigation, the agency will not speculate about the cause of the
accident.  * Based on initial reports, “there does not appear to be any impact
to foreign objects or other equipment,” the National Transportation Safety Board
said in an emailed statement, but noted that the derailment remains under
investigation.  * There was no immediate timetable for when normal train service
will resume.  * The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigation
involveslooking at the “human, machine, and the operating environment.”  *
Investigators will gather a number of records and information, including image
and event recorders from the locomotive, track maintenance and inspection
records, signal data, witness statements, and a 72-hour background of the crew
to determine “if there were any issues that could have affected the
operator/engineer’s ability to safety operate the train,” the agency said.  *
Witnesses to the derailment are asked to contact the agency.  * A preliminary
report will be available within 30 days, while a final report, which will detail
the probable cause of the crash and any contributing factors, is expected to be
released between one and two years from now, the federal agency said.   **UPDATE
AT 11:23 AM**  —via MBTA—  **GM ENG’s STATEMENT REGARDING DERAILMENT**  “We

Green Line trolley yesterday, and to riders who continue to be disrupted by the
shut down,” said MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng. “Safety continues to
be our top priority and this incident is unacceptable. We’re working alongside
our federal and state partners to understand what happened to make sure this
doesn’t happen again. We know this unplanned service change is a challenge, and

the MBTA's frontline customer service team, who are often found wearing red
shirts in stations, provided by private vendor Block by Block (BBB). T officials
pushed back on some of the findings, writing that one of the major takeaways
relied on a flawed methodology.  In an audit that covered the period from Jan.
1, 2021 through Dec. 31, 2022, DiZoglio's office found that BBB personnel
completed the number of station checks the MBTA sought — two per hour — on only
6% of staffed, contracted days.  MBTA officials, who have ramped up their
attention on station conditions under General Manager Phil Eng, replied that
although the agency ""encourages and requests"" two to four station checks per
hour, that threshold is ""not a contractual requirement."" The agency also said
DiZoglio's team deployed a methodology that ""negatively skews the data.""  ""For
example, if a second station inspection was conducted one minute after the hour,
the [auditor's office] nonetheless considered that hour to be a failure,"" the T
wrote in its response to the audit. ""BBB staffed approximately 646,000 base
hours during the audit period at various stations. A total of 1,743,971 total
station checks were conducted during that same period, averaging to
approximately 2.4 station checks per hour staffed.""  officials told DiZoglio's
office they did in fact provide documentation that all 60 employees in that
sample ""were trained on operations and safety before being assigned to any
independent shifts at subway stations."" Some of the gaps, they said, appeared to
be a result of incorrectly recorded deployment dates rather than insufficient
training.  But the auditor's office said the evidence provided by the MBTA ""was
not sufficient.""  ""In April 2024, the MBTA provided us with sign-in sheets
documenting the date of safety training along with each BBB employee's

challenges that prevent schedule changes from being announced on the signs or

arriving. Train rolled through the station without stopping, even though there
are passengers and seats available on board. Later, signs announce that the next
train is arriving. The arriving train just rolls through the station without

direction shows ETAs more often than inbound.)  I'm also curious about why the E
trains sometimes don't stop when they're announced as arriving? (Not out of
service trains, but ones with passengers and seats). What are some of the
challenges that prevent schedule changes from being announced on the signs or
intercom?  In one example yesterday, the signs said a Heath St train was
arriving. Train rolled through the station without stopping, even though there
are passengers and seats available on board. Later, signs announce that the next
train is arriving. The arriving train just rolls through the station without
stopping again, with passengers and open seats. Eventually another train came
(unannounced) and actually stopped. I'd love to understand the context so it's
less frustrating in the moment.",0.11127983033657074,0.8671067953109741,0.021613387390971184,-0.0896664410829544
1cgq82f,LET’s TALK ABOUT: Has the T actually improved? Analyzing the article “How has Phil Eng's first year at the T gone? It depends on who you ask” by WBUR.,"For this week’s discussion topic, I want to talk about this article I found on
WBUR.   This articles focuses on how Greater Bostonians feel about the MBTA
system as a whole.  We first hear from Stephanie Liu from Cambridge, who has
basically given up on the Red Line and has decided to use the 1 bus (which is
the most bunched, delayed, and crowded buses in the entire system):   * “The Red
Line's so slow, there's just closures everywhere,” Liu said. “And I just refuse
to sit on the Red Line or the Green Line anymore. I moved because I didn't want
to take the Red line to school anymore… “ (taking to Eng) Fix the T system,"" she
said. ""Like, we live in a city and we pay a lot of taxes and the T system
shouldn't be as broken as it is.”  I understand Liu’s concern as a Red Line
rider. The Red Line has gotten worse over the last year. However, this would not
be surprising when you realize the state has not adequately funded the T for 3
decades and has not placed those who are advocates for transit or has actually
worked in the transit sector in leadership positions. This is something that
should be more blamed on the state than on leadership.   I will say that the
amount of safety-related concerns that has happened is very concerning, however.
Eng needs to do a better job in this regard.    We also see that when Eng
started, there were 230 speed restrictions in place across the T system and on
his one-year anniversary, there were 116. This means that the Track Improvement
Program is actually working, with the understanding that there *will be slow
zones that may reappear*.  We also hear from Katie Calandriello from
TransitMatters:  “‘Katie Calandriello, policy analyst and program manager for
the nonprofit TransitMatters, said the group is ‘really excited’ about Eng’s
leadership and the initiative he's shown with the track improvement plan. But
she said the T has to do a better job communicating about repair-related service
disruptions. ‘There's still, like, riders that are showing up and have no idea
that the diversion is happening,’ Calandriello said.’”  I think that the MBTA
subreddit is trying to help do this by condensing information and pinning any
shutdown notices to the top of the page so that riders can see this. I would
also say that the T posts shutdowns notices in station through audio
announcements, screen PSAs, and online. I don’t exactly agree with this comment,
but I do think that the T can help make these notices more apparent by placing
notices across stations.  We also hear from Dorchester resident and Red Line
rider Woody Hayward:   “…He's been frustrated with communication around train
arrivals for the better part of the year. ‘Sometimes the little signs like
gaslight you or they're like, 'the train's going to be here in 10 minutes' and
you're like, 'OK, cool,' and then two or three minutes go by and it still says
10 minutes. And you're like, 'now they're just lying,' he said. Hayward and his
wife Rebecca said they pad their travel time by 15 minutes or prefer to walk
when they need to reach a destination on time. Despite that, Rebecca Hayward
said the T is ‘better than it was at the worst, but it seems like it's slow
progress. There's still a lot of issues to work out’”.  I do agree with this
point. The headways on the Red Line are really bad, and hopefully redesigning
the Alewife crossover and removing all slow zones will help increase service,
although things such as signals, people holding up the train, and other types of
delays will still cause these delays anyways. Slow progress is still progress,
however, so we should celebrate the small wins.  What do you guys think about

filled with officials shepherding people to where they need to be &amp; they
clearly increased the train frequency to handle the crush.  Lastly, I have an
easier time navigating other systems as a tourist at times than I do navigating
a system I take several times a week. First time I took the ferry to East
Boston, there was basically one sign telling me I was sorta in the right area.
Would it kill them to put more signs up on the docks &amp; one on the ferry so
every single person doesn't have to ask ""does this one go to Eastie?"". Imagine
being a tourist trying to get to Tufts on the GLX. Half the maps are telling you
that your stop doesn't even exist!!!  What really bothers me is that the latter
two paragraphs require little to no capital investment to improve upon. I think
it really illustrates how little MBTA officials care. &amp; I'm sick of hearing

12xjuo9,MBTA investigates RIDE driver who took Malden man on hours-long detour,"The MBTA has removed a driver from its RIDE service after a passenger with
cerebral palsy said the man turned what should have been a routine trip from
Malden to a Rotary Club meeting in Wakefield into a frustrating hours-long
ordeal, and repeatedly refused to take him home during the journey.  The
driver’s behavior was so unusual and troubling that a RIDE dispatcher took the
step of advising James Norris, the passenger, to call 911 for help, he said.
""Listen, he is going to be written up,” the dispatcher said of the driver,
according to Norris. ""But if you feel the need to call 911 and talk to the
police, you’re well within your rights to do so. ... We encourage you to do that
if you feel unsafe. Because at this point, there’s nothing else we can do.""
During a Globe interview over the weekend, Norris, 37, expressed anger over how
he was treated by the RIDE driver.  “It’s a terrible situation,” Norris said
about the incident, which occurred the evening of April 12. “It got to the point
where he stopped communicating with everybody. He just stayed silent.”  And
after finally dropping Norris off hours later in Wakefield, the driver canceled
Norris’s return trip home without telling him, he said.  Norris, who is the vice
president of the Malden Rotary Club, uses a power wheelchair for mobility, he
said. He is also the executive director of [Handi Capable
Fitness](https://www.handicapablefitness.com/), a nonprofit he founded to help
people living with disabilities stay active and healthy.  The T apologized to
Norris for “his troubling experience” and said it has launched an investigation
into what occurred during the RIDE trip, according to a statement released to
the Globe.  Norris confirmed that he was called by an MBTA official Saturday who
apologized for what happened. The call was placed less than an hour after the
Globe contacted the agency for comment.  Full story:

from Orient Heights on the Blue Line to Government Center, switching to the
Green Line to Park Street Station Monday morning where he took questions from
reporters.  On his ride, Eng said he spoke to riders and T workers. He said he
spoke to an “essential worker” who relied on the T during the pandemic.  “Just
listening to her and her dependence on the system is very inspiring, which is
all the more reason we have a lot of work to do to restore the service to where
it should be and make sure it’s safe,” he said.  Eng takes over the MBTA at a
time of intense frustration for riders who have endured drastic service cuts and
a long series of grave safety incidents over the last 18 months, including a
falling ceiling panel that nearly missed a commuter last month. Eng’s first day
also happens to be the one year anniversary of the dragging death of a Red Line
rider, 39 year old Robinson Lalin, at Broadway Station, which spurred, in part,
a federal safety inspection of the agency last year.  Eng offered his “deepest
sympathies to Robinson Lalin’s family,” calling his death a “tragic incident.”
He said he understands the public’s frustration about continued safety incidents
and reliability problems.  “I’m going to demonstrate that we can turn it
around,” he said. “You’ll start to see meaningful improvements. It’ll be slow at
the beginning. But as you start to see them come, I think people will regain

first, we downvoted, we laughed. Then we realized it was happening everywhere —
Downtown Crossing, Park Street, Alewife. The details varied, but the essence

tap and slip through behind you like a fare-dodging phantom.  They called him
***The Piggybacker.***  Nobody’s ever seen his face clearly. Some say he wears a
Sox cap pulled low. Others claim he materializes only during signal delays,
emerging from the ether between **“The next ALEWIFE train is now approaching
WITH ALL NEW RED LINE CARS.”** announcements.  One witness swears she felt a
warm gust of Dunkin’-scented air moments before the second gate beeped. Another
reports hearing the faint whisper of *“Thanks, bro.”* Followed by the
*swish-swosh* of his jeans, barely hung on by belt loose around his waist.
Transit Police have issued conflicting statements. One press release called him
“an ongoing concern.” Another from Phil Eng insists “fare evasion is under
control.” Meanwhile, the CharlieCard readers continue to beep twice in the
night, behind the backdrop of  *""Hi, I'm Phil Eng, General Manager of the MBTA.
Riders who don't pay thei fare may receive a warning or a fine. Thank you for
doing your part for keeping the T running for everyone.""*  Some believe *The
Piggybacker* is a man. Others think he’s an inner machination of the collective
Boston hivemind — a manifestation of collective commuter rage, born from
20-minute headways and broken escalators.  Rumor has it he now posts among us.
Sometimes a new account appears, defending the act: *“Bruh it’s not that deep…*

***The Piggybacker.***  Nobody’s ever seen his face clearly. Some say he wears a
Sox cap pulled low. Others claim he materializes only during signal delays,
emerging from the ether between **“The next ALEWIFE train is now approaching
WITH ALL NEW RED LINE CARS.”** announcements.  One witness swears she felt a
warm gust of Dunkin’-scented air moments before the second gate beeped. Another
reports hearing the faint whisper of *“Thanks, bro.”* Followed by the
*swish-swosh* of his jeans, barely hung on by belt loose around his waist.
Transit Police have issued conflicting statements. One press release called him
“an ongoing concern.” Another from Phil Eng insists “fare evasion is under
control.” Meanwhile, the CharlieCard readers continue to beep twice in the
night, behind the backdrop of  *""Hi, I'm Phil Eng, General Manager of the MBTA.
Riders who don't pay thei fare may receive a warning or a fine. Thank you for
doing your part for keeping the T running for everyone.""*  Some believe *The
Piggybacker* is a man. Others think he’s an inner machination of the collective
Boston hivemind — a manifestation of collective commuter rage, born from
20-minute headways and broken escalators.  Rumor has it he now posts among us.
Sometimes a new account appears, defending the act: *“Bruh it’s not that deep…*
\~ u/memeology_69  ""*oh my god no one cares*"" \~ u/Eastern_Belt_8409
Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe *he* reads these threads too.  So stay sharp,
Boston. Hold your ground when you hear footsteps behind you.   Protect your
CharlieCard.   Don’t hesitate at the gate.  And if you feel someone close enough
to share your personal-space bubble… just remember:  **The Piggybacker rides
free — and he always rides again.**",0.5102719068527222,0.4630174934864044,0.02671058289706707,-0.48356133699417114

1gtrxmc,The (MTA) TrainTime app is what the (MBTA) mTicket app should be,"I visited NYC this weekend and took both the LIRR and Metro-North a few times to
get to various things. The ticket/scheduling app for the MTA commuter rails is
TrainTime and the user experience is absolutely stellar.  It includes live train
tracking, schedules, and delay/change alerts, on top of ticket purchasing and QR
code display. I can plug in any two stations and it will not only tell me the
next departure I can take to do that trip, but it will give me a button right on
that screen to buy a ticket for it. No knowledge of zones or line names
required.   Even more impressive (to me at least) is it handles cross-system
connections seamlessly. Just to test it I plugged in a trip from Mets-Willets
Point (on the LIRR in Queens) to Yankees-153rd (on Metro-North in the Bronx). It
immediately came up with an itinerary that had me transferring at Grand Central
(and showed me the ""layover"" time) and again let me buy a single ticket that
would cover me for the whole trip.  Can we get the same contractor that built
TrainTime to rebuild mTicket for the T? Why do I buy a ticket from SS to
Readville but then have to go lookup the schedule of a few different lines to
find the next departure that's actually going there? Wouldn't it be nice if the

162rmb3,what happened on the green line yesterday?,"yesterday I waited for about 45 minutes at North Station to catch a Union Square
train but they kept getting taken out of service - both Medford and Union trains
were all stopping at North and dropping everyone off, and the conductors kept
saying another train was coming so we kept waiting. the attendants in the
station didn't say anything was out of the ordinary. eventually I decided to
just get out of the station and wander the north end for like an hour, then went
back to the station where many people were still waiting for a green line. the
attendants then came out and told us to take shuttle buses. we all went upstairs
to wait for shuttles, and they said one would be there in 10 minutes. 25 minutes
later, they had us illegally cross the street in front of TD gardens and wait on
the other side. 3 buses were lined up but not accepting passengers because the
drivers didn't know where they were supposed to be taking us. the driver of the
bus I got on said he works in Lynn and this was supposed to be his day off. the
front 2 buses both went to Medford, and the last one went to Lechmere. I got off
at Lechmere and people were running around like headless chickens there trying
to get where they needed to go because there was no signage and nobody had any
directions. I eventually got a 69 bus to Harvard that was super delayed
apparently and got off along the way because there was no direct way to get to
Union Square - the trains were still down and no shuttles were going that way.
it was a pretty annoying experience. luckily I had nowhere I really needed to be

a good watch &amp; I wanted to share my takeaways from it.    His 1st talking
point is the Canada line in Vancouver.  It cost less than 2 billion CAD &amp;
opened ahead of schedule.  They standardized stations &amp; driverless trains to
have reliable &amp; frequent service.  The private operator  will operate the
line for a set number of years per their contract. When it ends, the public
transit operator &amp; government takes over. Ive heard 2 conflicting numbers
about the length of the contract. The video says its 30 years, while Wikipedia
says its 35. Just throwing that out there.   His 2nd talking point was line 9 of
the Seoul metro. The private company in that case was at odds with the
government about ticket prices. It seems they've managed to figure that out, but
it could be a problem in the future. The operator essentially wanted to charge a
higher fare for using their line compared to the rest of the system.    Fares
did rise system wide eventually, but  they wanted to add an additional increase.

excuse that the increase was to account for inflation. I'll include a link to a

the recent Green Line derailment resulted from excessive speed and operational
negligence. This incident underscores the need for the MBTA to reinforce strict
adherence to safety protocols across all levels of its operations.   We strongly
urge the MBTA to commit to a thorough review of its training and operational
oversight to ensure that all operators follow established safety rules. The
safety of riders and employees alike must remain a top priority, and these
incidents must be prevented at all costs.   While operator negligence appears to
have been a key factor in this derailment, we hope that the MBTA is also
examining the low-speed design of the switch where this event occurred. A design
review could lead to adjustments that accommodate higher operating speeds,
improving efficiency on the line and reducing the risk of future incidents.
Additionally, this derailment highlights the urgent need for the long-overdue
overhaul of the Green Line’s signal system. An upgraded system would likely have
mitigated the overspeed that led to this derailment and could prevent similar

1dfpdzv,I wrote a letter to your State Rep about Funding The T so you didn’t have to!,"Dear Representative [Representative's Last Name],  I am writing to you as a
resident of [Your Town or Community], a community significantly reliant on the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) for daily commuting and
economic activity. I am deeply concerned about the potential service cuts to the
MBTA, which threaten not only our ability to commute but also the broader
economic stability and vibrancy of our community outside Boston.  The MBTA’s
Board of Directors recently approved a budget of $3 billion for the fiscal year
2025, which is a commendable effort to maintain the system’s operational
integrity in the short term. However, this budget uses reserve funds to close a
current funding gap, a stopgap measure that is unsustainable in the long run.
With an impending $700 million shortfall anticipated for fiscal year 2026, the
threat of significant service cuts looms large, which would be catastrophic for
constituents like us who depend on these services for our daily lives.  The
persistent underperformance of key revenue sources, such as state sales tax and
fare collections, exacerbates this issue. Sales tax revenue, which is partly
allocated to fund the MBTA, has grown at a disappointing average annual rate of
2.29% over the past two decades, far below the projected 6.46 to 8.50%. This
shortfall has resulted in a cumulative loss ranging from $8.9 to $15.5 billion,
severely limiting the MBTA's financial capacity to invest in necessary
infrastructure improvements and expansions.  Additionally, the change in
commuting patterns post-pandemic and the decrease in the use of monthly passes
have led to fare revenues hovering at only about 60% of pre-pandemic levels.
These factors, combined with necessary but disruptive track replacements and
repairs, have deterred ridership. While there have been initiatives to make
parts of the system fare-free to mitigate these impacts, such measures are not a
long-term solution to the underlying financial instability.  Given these
challenges, I urge you to take a proactive role in advocating for innovative and
sustainable funding solutions that will support the MBTA's operational and
capital needs. It is imperative that the state legislature explore a variety of
funding mechanisms, such as:  1. Adjusting the Formula for State Sales Tax
Allocation - Consider revising the percentage of state sales tax dedicated to
the MBTA to better reflect the current economic realities and the critical
importance of the transit system.     2. Implementing Congestion Pricing -
Introduce congestion pricing for vehicular traffic in high-density areas during
peak times, with revenues earmarked specifically for public transportation
funding.     3. Public-Private Partnerships - Encourage partnerships with
businesses that benefit from a robust public transit system, potentially through
direct investment or tax incentives for contributions to transit funding.  4.
Federal Funding Opportunities - Actively pursue additional federal grants and
funding through newly available infrastructure initiatives, ensuring that
Massachusetts maximizes its receipt of national resources dedicated to public
transportation.  It is crucial that we treat the maintenance and improvement of
the MBTA not just as a fiscal challenge, but as an opportunity to enhance the
quality of life for all Massachusetts residents, foster economic development,
and reduce environmental impact. Our community, and many others like it, rely on
the MBTA for access to jobs, education, healthcare, and more. The prospect of
reduced services could have dire consequences on our day-to-day living and
economic opportunities.  Thank your for your attention to this pressing issue. I

tonight:  **Stated goals:**  * Faster travel times on public transport between
Lynn and Wonderland * Make the Lynnway less dangerous * Build out transit for
ongoing and future redevelopment of the commercial areas * Preserve a major
private vehicle access road to Nahant, Swampscott, and Marblehead  **About the
design:**  * They don't have a plan, they have concepts of a plan. Nothing is
final.  * There will be a minimum of 2 private vehicle travel lanes between the
bridge and Market St * No commitment to center-running bus lanes but at least
some form of bus priority seems very likely, the MBTA's Bus Priority Project
Manager was the presenter after all. * Technically a different project but the
replacement for the General Edwards bridge will feature a bi-directional shared
use path. Continuation of this path along the Lynnway seems overwhelmingly
likely. * The presenter was fairly pessimistic about pedestrian overpasses but
as mentioned, nothing is final.  * Stated preference to avoid eminent domain so
don't a complete overhaul of the entire area.  **General participant
sentiments:**  * Both pro and anti bike/bus lane speakers, some more well stated
than others shall we say * Lots of confusion about the redevelopment plans, and
a lot of people not aware that there is any redevelopment at all * Nahant was
wildly over-represented in speakers. Lynn folks need to come out! Your town,
your politicians and planners, your vote!  **Subjective opinions about the

utility of having the meetings at this stage.  * If these meetings are
happening, the format is absolutely terrible. This should be an open-house,
interactive style event where people can see models and diagrams of what is
being considered for the area. Without that there's just a lot of generic talk
that could be a 2 sentence email. * If the format is going to be this, the

1lwkyhv,Commuter rail repair and expansion projects,"This is just an observation I've made watching the SCR rollout, the bill to run
the CapeFLYER full time, and the post about bringing the MBTA up to
Nashua/Manchester/Concord, but it seems like Boston and eastern MA are a lot
more focused on expanding the network to new cities and towns in the periphery
than they are on making sure those expansions are frequent and high-quality.
The SCR rollout got screwed because of the bottleneck on the Old Colony Lines
between Braintree and Andrew, and any CapeFLYER expansion would run straight
into that same bottleneck. Among existing services, Haverhill gets shafted with
90-minute frequencies (and yes, I'm salty about it because I commute
reverse-peak from Boston to Lawrence), and most lines run every 35 minutes or
worse reverse peak and every two hours on weekends. The system works somewhat
decently for the 9-5 commuter market, but isn't terribly useful outside of that
unless you get *very* lucky.  My personal opinion is that we should probably
place a moratorium on new expansions further out into the periphery until we've
done the work to build a system core that can reliably handle 15-minute peak and
20-30 minute off-peak service on each branch, and what I'm proposing below is
what I think a realistic path to getting there looks like:  1. Rebuild the Old
Colony lines between Andrew and Braintree to double-track, with a triple-track
overtake from Savin Hill to JFK-UMass. Make room for the northern half of this
by moving the Red Line branch point from Andrew to the location where the
Ashmont branch turns right toward Fields Corner. For the southern half of this
you need to widen the ROW probably by 5-7 feet. 2. Add passing sidings to the
Greenbush, Plymouth, and outer Haverhill lines with an eye toward full
double-tracking of those lines, and double track the entire Middleboro-Lakeville
Line 3. Add quad-track overtakes on the NEC near Mansfield and Hyde Park, and on
the Worcester line at Framingham, near Wellesley Hills, and near Westborough 4.
Fully double-track the outer Franklin Line, SCR Phase II, the outer Newburyport
and outer Rockport Lines, and the entire Haverhill Line, rebuild Waltham as a
triple-track elevated station, and double-track the Wildcat Branch 5. Electrify
the core of the network (out to Beverly, Reading, Lowell, Concord, Framingham,
Walpole, and Brockton), build pocket tracks at those locations, and build a
quad-track NSRL. Buy a set of Stadler FLIRTs or KISSes and start through-running
electric trains on the core network 6. Double-track the Needham Line to Needham
Junction and hand that over to the Orange Line 7. Rebuild key junctions (Reading
Junction near Sullivan Sq, the Wildcat junctions in Wilmington, Canton Junction,
the junctions near Braintree) as flyovers so that diverging trains don't foul
the mainline. 8. Extend electrification across the entire network, and start
through-running all commuter rail service except a small number of rush-hour
specials. 9. Quad-track the entire NEC down to Providence and add a new
two-track high-speed ROW from East Junction to Providence via Rumford. 10. Add
triple- or quad-track overtakes on the Middleboro-Lakeville line near Brockton
and Bridgewater, on the Haverhill Line near Lawrence and Reading, on the Lowell
Line near Anderson RTC and South Lowell, on the Fitchburg Line at Concord and
Ayer, and on the Newburyport Line at Newburyport and Chelsea 11. Add full-time
CapeFLYER service year-round, expand Downeaster service, and run East-West Rail
to Springfield via Worcester and North Adams via Greenfield. 12. Extend Lowell
Line express trains to Manchester and Concord, re-extend the Greenbush Line to
Plymouth on the old alignment to Marshfield, extend Newburyport trains up to
Portsmouth  Basically, Step 1 fixes the single nastiest bottleneck on the whole
system by freeing up the Old Colony Lines to run at up to 15-20tph combined
north of Braintree, and then Step 2 starts working on strategically adding
double track in places that allow for higher frequencies. Step 3 makes it easier
to boost frequencies on lines that we expect to be shared between local and
express service (whether the express service is MBTA or Amtrak), and Step 4
allows branch frequencies to only be limited by track space in the core.  Step 5
gets you high frequencies in the inner core of the network; pairing a
half-hourly diesel or dual-mode train from North or South station out to the
edges of the network with a half-hourly electric train that runs from one edge
of the core to the other gets you 15-minute service in the core and frees up
tracks in the stub end bits of North and South Station.  Steps 6 and 7 are about
strategic decongestion near the core as frequencies increase; by taking flat
junctions and making them flyovers you make it much easier to route large
numbers of trains through the core without having to wait for junctions to
clear.  Step 8 gets us our climate goals, and lets us get rid of our old diesel
fleet for lighter, faster electric trains across the main network.  Steps 9 and
10 are less about the current commuter rail and more about building the
necessary infrastructure for MA to have a coherent state rail system centered
around Boston. A quad-track NEC and frequent triple- and quad-track overtakes on
the lines that would carry expresses from outside greater Boston (Newburyport,
Haverhill, Lowell, Fitchburg, and Middleboro-Lakeville) make it much easier to
slot current longer-distance express services like the Downeaster, the Lake
Shore Limited (as well as proposed long-distance expresses like trains to
Hyannis, Springfield, North Adams/Greenfield, Manchester/Concord, and
Portsmouth) in amongst the frequent commuter traffic without delays and
bottlenecks, but at *much* lower cost than fully quad-tracking all the corridors
that might carry longer-distance trains.  Finally, Steps 11 and 12 are the
payoff for Western MA, southern NH, and the south shore; having gotten the core
of the network properly built out and having pulled most if not all of the
commuter trains out of the terminating platforms at North and South Station we
*now* have room to start adding new services from outlying cities and towns into
Boston.

1juetex,MBTA LinkPass not accepted on East Boston ferry,"Good morning!   Apologies if this is a well-known issue, it's new to me and I
tried to look through the subreddit. I learned this morning on my commute that
the East Boston MBTA ferry no longer accepts the green LinkPass card my employer
provides me.      It's a huge bummer! I love riding my bike to work, but living
in Eastie the only feasible way to get my bike over to the ""mainland"" during
rush hour is the ferry. I moved here in September and only got to use my bike
for a short while (after settling in) before the ferry ""season"" ended. I've been
looking forward to April since then when I could ride again, and have been doing
so despite the terrible weather -- only to learn this morning that the pass
(which I've already paid for!) is no longer accepted.      So the only way to
ride the ferry is to pay again for another pass? Dagnabit.      Any ideas or
solutions for this? The LinkPass is awesome for all other transit in my
experience - but this one, unique, neat aspect of public transit in a port city
that allows me to get some exercise and blow off some steam is no longer :(
Edit: I called it a LinkPass when I meant to say it's the green [Perq for

tried to look through the subreddit. I learned this morning on my commute that
the East Boston MBTA ferry no longer accepts the green LinkPass card my employer
provides me.      It's a huge bummer! I love riding my bike to work, but living
in Eastie the only feasible way to get my bike over to the ""mainland"" during
rush hour is the ferry. I moved here in September and only got to use my bike
for a short while (after settling in) before the ferry ""season"" ended. I've been
looking forward to April since then when I could ride again, and have been doing
so despite the terrible weather -- only to learn this morning that the pass
(which I've already paid for!) is no longer accepted.      So the only way to
ride the ferry is to pay again for another pass? Dagnabit.      Any ideas or
solutions for this? The LinkPass is awesome for all other transit in my
experience - but this one, unique, neat aspect of public transit in a port city
that allows me to get some exercise and blow off some steam is no longer :(
Edit: I called it a LinkPass when I meant to say it's the green [Perq for
employees card](https://www.mbta.com/pass-program/perq/perq-employees) which I

both Orange and E Line), Hynes (connecting with B/C/D Lines), and a new MIT

But it feels like a public transport failure relative to other major cities.
Disregarding the shut downs last year which made a 45 min commute a 1.5 hour
commute thanks to busses, the things I’ve noticed as of late are:  1. One of the
“up” escalators at Porter being down for several weeks, haven’t seen anyone
actively working to fix it.  2. Train times completely misaligned with the
posted schedule (google maps is useless - you don’t know until you get to the
station). 3. Extended stops/delays either at or between 50% of stations.  I
basically need to factor in an extra 20-25 minutes into my morning commute to
account for “how the red line is feeling” on a given day.    This is not normal
in other cities. Is this normal in Boston, or is it just the red line? I’m not
hating on MBTA as a whole, I’m just curious if there is one particular
bureaucrat in charge of the red line who sucks at their job, or if it’s a more
systemic issue.   Update: 1 day after posting - the STAIRS next to the broken

“existential crisis,” cities and towns that help fund the system warned, as the
MBTA moves ahead with a budget plan that drains its reserves in the face of a
looming deficit.    A T subcommittee voted Thursday to advance a $3.02 billion
fiscal year 2025 budget that would effectively empty the MBTA’s savings to help
drive up spending by 11 percent, leaving no bulwark against a nearly $700
million gap forecast to hit in the following year.    Shortly afterward, the
MBTA Advisory Board — an independent watchdog that represents the 176 cities and
towns served by the T — published an analysis of the spending plan with a stark
warning about what’s on the horizon.    “The riding public, cities and towns,
and all stakeholders face terrible options if the MBTA’s $696 million deficit is
not closed in the next 13 months,” the organization wrote. “This comes at a time
when MBTA ridership has not returned, and analysis suggests that it is unlikely
to return anytime soon given both a flattening of growth versus general
expectations for recovery. The fear is that no action will take place, and
service cuts will be the only available solution if the Authority is forced to
solve its deficits internally.”

wqpoi6,Commuter Rail Pricing and why can it not be lowered,"So, I was in Lowell and I wanted to go see my friend near Savin Hill, with
parking being a pain and the drive taking an hour , I wanted to just take the
commuter rail, green line, red line which woul take 1:15, so not terribly more
but with more comfort.   The problem is the price. 11 dollars one way from
Lowell, and then 2.70 on the subway. I have no problem with the 2.70 fare but
there's no need for it to cost so much for me to get from Lowell , when it
literally is cheaper for me to drive.  At the end of the day, people look for
quality , comfort , and price. The price of driving is cheaper than taking the
train, the comfort is more on the train, but the quality bc you may have to wait
a while for a train is also its downfall. Overall, taking a car wins.  Also,so
many people take busses to places like Lynn , Belmont, Waltham , Newton and its
a 7.00 fare which is more expensive than bus plus subway. Why is the price not
lowered to 3.00 within Zones 1 and 2 to encourage people to take the train
instead of the bus, as well as people that would normally drive.    Increase it
50 cents per zone, so Lowell would be a 5.00 ride instead of 11.00 and Worcester
would be a 6.00 ride instead of 12.00  .  With prices this low, there would be
more packed trains bc fewer would choose the car,  and would be great for the

1kg0o8q,What do people think about the free weekends? NB/FR Line,"Been riding during the free weekends on the new Bedford/Fall river and the
information being given is sorta all over the place/poorly or even rudely given
at times about it being free or paid or other communication from crew.  The
previous holiday weekend we had pretty good crews, Saturday they gave train
number, stops and explained what stops were free and weren't, on holiday Monday
because our train left over 30 minutes late didn't care about collecting fares,
thought no one in South station provided information other than it was delayed.
This past weekend it was very mixed we had an okayish crew going in, they didn't
collect fares either past the new stations either. On the way back we got an
extremely awful crew that seemed to know nothing and didn't care to inform
anyone property instead saying over the intercom to active tickets and not
saying anything about the free stops, on top of that they seemed to not
understand that the redline wasn't running and was free too because the
conductor instead wanted to get into a fight when we spoke up because she wanted
to charge someone getting off at braintree when it was free due to no service
and then wanted to give us sas when I tried to explained how the previous
weekend another conductor explained it over the intercom and that's a bit more
informative and less vague than doing it in person. Instead she just got annoyed
and said that's them and again tried to sas me about what stops were free or not
(even after not knowing and seemingly charging people for the redline shutdown
stops)  My only real reason for saying anything at all was that I feel like the
crews should do a better job explaining this (still pretty funny she didn't even
know about the redline shutdown) because alot of riders I seen are new ones and
just saying ""activate your tickets"" makes them second guess if the service is
actually free and could accidentally cause people to buy tickets when they
didn't need to.  And maybe I'm not the only person but I feel like the MBTA
should just offer some kind of free service for all of the Middleborough line
because yeah the new stops are new but it has caused people who always took the
train immense issues the last few weekends that originally didn't have issues
yet they still getting charged while they fix the mess keolis caused.  The rest
of May is free so we'll see how the crews respond onwards, I already read an
article about one of the local senators asking for answers and saying that we
should get free service whenever service is fully recovered (tho crossing my
fingers the last weekend was fine I guess we'll see if that continues I think
keolis is scared after that 51k fine)  I'm curious if anyone else have
encountered this on there trips or not, I always personally joked about how the

1fej90v,MyCharlie website &amp; support team both awful - why do they mail you a new card without warning?,"I get pre-tax commuter benefits through work, so I had Auto-pay set up on my
CharlieCard to get the $90 LinkPass every month, starting late August for
September use.  Well, it charged my benefits card the $90, but whenever I
scanned my CharlieCard at the turnstile (using the older contact pads), the
screen would report “Not enough value“. Uh… what?  **The way I thought it
worked:** You type in the serial number of your *existing* pass on the website,
your credit card is charged, and the value on the pass is updated automatically.
I’ve used this website to refill the value of my card remotely in the past, and
I never expected them to retire this functionality.  **The way it actually
works:** When you set up Auto-pay for the first time, they MAIL YOU A WHOLE NEW
CARD. This is apparently covered in the
[FAQ](https://www.mbta.com/fares/auto-pay/about-auto-pay), which I wouldn’t
think to check beforehand:
https://preview.redd.it/fudxplmyc8od1.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e137f29ea1a8bca0ed2bf927f273da0ac35d3fac
However:  1. The fact that you are getting a new card is mentioned NOWHERE on
the website before or after setting up Auto-pay 2. They do not e-mail you to
tell you a new card is on the way 3. To the best of my knowledge, no mail has
come in containing the new card with my September LinkPass value on it. Even if
it were to arrive soon, we are almost halfway through September and in the
meantime I have been buying individual fares on top of the $90 I already spent.
Not knowing anything about this process, I was surprised to see on my MyCharlie
dashboard that there were now two cards… at the time I thought OK, well this is
clearly a mistake; the Auto-pay value should have gone onto the card I actually
have in my possession, not this mysterious ghost-card that doesn’t exist.  So I
called customer service (1-888-844-0355), and I get this guy who just sounds
annoyed that he even has to pick up the phone at all. I explain that I have
Auto-pay set up but my card isn't working. After making me hold to bring up my
information he just goes “OK we'll send you a new card in 3–5 business days” or
whatever. Meanwhile I'm like uh… but I already have a card?? I was assuming he
would actually try to get to the bottom of my specific problem. He immediately
starts talking to me like a moron; his voice dripping with condescension. “Yes,
but you said the card doesn’t work… So we’re sending you a new one…”  In
hindsight, I can see where the disconnect was: He thought I was saying my
existing *Auto-pay card* (which I did not know was a separate thing, and which I
don’t actually have) wasn’t working. In reality, I was saying that my existing
*CharlieCard* wasn’t working, which is apparently *expected behavior*.  But he
made no effort to clarify what I meant.  I was like, “OK but how do I know the
same thing won't happen?”  “Well, you’ll just have to try the new card.”  I
intervene with “Hold on, I’m looking at my dashboard—just seeing this for the
first time that I have two cards on there?”  “Sir, you can only set up Auto-pay
with one card.”  “Yeah but I didn’t add the second card…”  And the guy just gets
annoyed and tries explaining slowly that they just have to replace the card, as
if I am being totally unreasonable. His tone is so enraging that I just hang up
on him, which I normally would never do. I just had so little patience for his
default impatience.  So yeah, just a shitty product and a shitty customer
service to top it all off. There has been NO communication on this change, or
even WHY it’s necessary from a technical standpoint. If it was true that you
could load value to a CharlieCard remotely in the past, why is that no longer
the case? If you can process an individual transaction at random intervals, you
can surely process individual transactions at fixed intervals. It makes no
goddamn sense. I can only surmise that they are pretending that Auto-pay has
some unique quality to it as an excuse to upgrade the security of the passes,
because the older ones have some kind of flaw in them (I recall the MIT students
who were able to hack them; I don’t know if that was ever resolved).  In short,
they are in serious need of User Interface or User Experience experts on the
team. This is leagues below the baseline usability standards of any modern
web-based application. Additionally, they are in need of more empathetic and/or
technically proficient support personnel. I understand that they are probably
inundated with trivial or nonsensical requests, but I called in over a simple
misunderstanding and was treated like dirt.  This experience has left such a bad
taste in my mouth that I ended up canceling my Auto-pay subscription and will
probably end up canceling my commuter benefits at work as well. There is no way
I come anywhere close to taking $90 worth of T rides in a month in the first
place; I would be better off just doing the individual debit charges using the
OMNY-style terminals. I was just doing the LinkPass for “convenience” (lol) and
to throw a bone to this underfunded organization.

starts talking to me like a moron; his voice dripping with condescension. “Yes,
but you said the card doesn’t work… So we’re sending you a new one…”  In
hindsight, I can see where the disconnect was: He thought I was saying my
existing *Auto-pay card* (which I did not know was a separate thing, and which I
don’t actually have) wasn’t working. In reality, I was saying that my existing
*CharlieCard* wasn’t working, which is apparently *expected behavior*.  But he
made no effort to clarify what I meant.  I was like, “OK but how do I know the
same thing won't happen?”  “Well, you’ll just have to try the new card.”  I
intervene with “Hold on, I’m looking at my dashboard—just seeing this for the
first time that I have two cards on there?”  “Sir, you can only set up Auto-pay
with one card.”  “Yeah but I didn’t add the second card…”  And the guy just gets
annoyed and tries explaining slowly that they just have to replace the card, as
if I am being totally unreasonable. His tone is so enraging that I just hang up
on him, which I normally would never do. I just had so little patience for his
default impatience.  So yeah, just a shitty product and a shitty customer
service to top it all off. There has been NO communication on this change, or
even WHY it’s necessary from a technical standpoint. If it was true that you
could load value to a CharlieCard remotely in the past, why is that no longer
the case? If you can process an individual transaction at random intervals, you
can surely process individual transactions at fixed intervals. It makes no
goddamn sense. I can only surmise that they are pretending that Auto-pay has
some unique quality to it as an excuse to upgrade the security of the passes,
because the older ones have some kind of flaw in them (I recall the MIT students
who were able to hack them; I don’t know if that was ever resolved).  In short,
they are in serious need of User Interface or User Experience experts on the
team. This is leagues below the baseline usability standards of any modern
web-based application. Additionally, they are in need of more empathetic and/or
technically proficient support personnel. I understand that they are probably
inundated with trivial or nonsensical requests, but I called in over a simple
misunderstanding and was treated like dirt.  This experience has left such a bad
taste in my mouth that I ended up canceling my Auto-pay subscription and will
probably end up canceling my commuter benefits at work as well. There is no way
I come anywhere close to taking $90 worth of T rides in a month in the first
place; I would be better off just doing the individual debit charges using the
OMNY-style terminals. I was just doing the LinkPass for “convenience” (lol) and

weekend. Just thought I’d share my experience out on the line today, since we
didn’t get our usual slow zone update.   Disclaimer: The information in this
post is sourced purely from my anecdotal experience as a Red Line Motorperson
(driver). We’ll see what the actual numbers look like when they come out,
probably tomorrow  **Southbound, Main Line:** * Still 10mph all the way from
Alewife to Porter * 10mph about 1/3 of the way from Charles MGH to Park Street,
and continuing all the way through DTX and part of the way to South Station *
10mph from Broadway all the way through Andrew and to JFK. Absolutely grueling.
**Southbound, Braintree Line:** * LARGE new 10mph slow zone between JFK and
North Quincy. They put down a TON of new ballast in this area over the weekend
though, so this slow zone *should* be lifted within the coming weeks as the new
ballast settles * Possibly a few new 25mph zones, but I don’t notice those
nearly as much as the god-awful 10mph restrictions  **Northbound, Braintree
Line** * Large stretch of 10mph restriction between Braintree and Quincy Adams.
There is new ballast here too, so this should be lifted in the coming weeks as
it settles. * North Quincy to JFK has been improved significantly. It is now a
40mph zone over about 1/2 of that stretch, which feels massively better
considering the distance between those stops. There are a few areas with new
ballast and a 25mph restriction. However, it does still drop down to 10mph
approaching the Devaughn flyover, through JFK and to the 12-1 signal, where is
picks back up to 25mph * From Andrew to Broadway, it is 25mph halfway until it

basically one massive slow zone. Absolutely horrendous. I feel deeply for anyone
who uses this line for their daily commute. Driving it sucks but at least I’m
being paid for my misery. Hopefully it will be improved in the weeks-months

__________________  Raw sewage in Alewife Brook: The unfinished chapter of
Boston Harbor cleanup By Hadley Barndollar | HBarndollar@masslive.com  When the
flood waters receded in the basement of Kristin Anderson’s Arlington home, she
found toilet paper, condoms and tampon applicators strewn throughout, left
behind by the dirty water.  Afterward, she suffered through days of sickness,
namely painful gastrointestinal issues. It was then she realized the Alewife
Brook had quite literally entered her home, and with it, raw sewage.  “It came
right in through the back door after the brook overflowed its banks,” Anderson
recalled. “It was pretty traumatic.”  In Cambridge, where the Alewife Brook
originates, a single outfall pipe located behind the graffiti-laden Alewife MBTA
parking garage is a leading source of sewage discharged into the brook during
periods of heavy rainfall — which data shows are only getting heavier because of
climate change.  It’s an issue that traces back decades to the Boston Harbor
Cleanup case, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency embarked on an
all-hands-on-deck approach to what was, at the time, considered one of the
dirtiest harbors in America.  The court-mandated projects cost more than $4
billion, spurred by two 1980s lawsuits that ultimately led a federal judge to
require the construction of the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant and
supplemental cleanup endeavors.  Today, Boston Harbor is often highlighted as a
national EPA enforcement success story. However, outlying pieces still remain,
such as the sewage issue in the Alewife Brook.  In 2023 alone, 26 million total
gallons of untreated sewage were discharged into the brook, making it the site
of the highest concentration of sewage outfall in the Boston area, according to
the Mystic River Watershed Association.  Data shows about two-thirds of it comes
from the particular outfall labeled by the city of Cambridge as CAM 401A, which
remains noncompliant with the Boston Harbor cleanup plan and sits
inconspicuously on the edge of the Alewife Brook Reservation.  Approximately
5,000 people live in the Alewife Brook’s 100-year flood plain between Cambridge,
Arlington and Belmont. And with the nearby MBTA station and new developments
containing luxury apartments and biotech companies, thousands of people traverse
around the river daily — and specifically, the 401A outfall known to spill over
onto walking paths.  Photos have circulated over the years of a father pushing a
baby stroller through sewage on a path. A young girl riding her bike through
what appears to be rain puddles — but aren’t.  “We aren’t supposed to be coming
into contact with untreated, raw sewage,” said Marja Copeland, stormwater
project manager for the Mystic River Watershed Association.  State-mandated plan
update  The city of Cambridge completed a project in 2013 that separated sewer
and stormwater pipe infrastructure for more than 420 acres. It featured the
creation of the Alewife Stormwater Wetland, a massive nature-based solution for
stormwater management that essentially “pre-treats” stormwater before it flows
into the river.  At that time, it cost more than $150 million. Future sewer
projects in Cambridge — such as pipe separation, sewage storage tanks, tunnels
and more — will certainly surpass that.  And according to the federal Clean
Water Act’s water quality standards, sewage isn’t supposed to be discharged into
Alewife Brook. The state, however, has issued temporary variances to allow it
while the involved parties work toward additional solutions.  Toilet paper and
“floatables” — really anything that is flushed down the toilet — can be seen
buoyant in Alewife Brook during combined sewer overflow (CSO) events. Homeless
encampments had to be moved from the area several times, the individuals
entirely unaware of what they were exposed to when hard rain fell.  “We’re
talking hundreds of millions to billions,” said Lucica Hiller, a senior project
manager for Cambridge’s Department of Public Works. “I think in general we
expect these projects to be funded by water and sewer rates and property taxes.
There’s limited federal funding for this type of work.”  Currently, Cambridge,
Somerville and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) are updating
their long-term controlled sewer overflow plans that were required by the Boston
Harbor federal court case, charting a course for future improvements that will,
they hope, decimate sewer discharge.  The first iteration of the approved plan,
completed in 2015, included 35 projects that cost more than $900 million.
Hrycyna called the sewer overflows into Alewife Brook an example of “the
recalcitrant, last, unfinished chapter of the cleanup of Boston Harbor.”  An
updated long-term control plan was one of the requirements set forth by the
state Department of Environmental Protection when it granted variances from
Clean Water Act standards to permit sewer discharge into the Alewife Brook,
while the MWRA and its partner communities implement solutions.  It’s a public
health concern, but also an ecological one — Alewife Brook is regularly reported
to have some of the worst water quality in the Boston area, affecting the
ability of wildlife to thrive, as well as human recreation.  “The amount of
sewage pollution in that brook, it’s just unfathomable when you look at the size
of it,” said Anderson, the Arlington resident who ultimately formed Save the
Alewife Brook, a grassroots community group of residents working to end sewer
discharge into the river.  What are combined sewer overflows?  On a wet morning
in May, Copeland and her colleague Andy Hrycyna, water quality program manager
for the Mystic River Watershed Association, walked around a MassLive reporter
around Alewife Brook Reservation.  The surrounding area has become densely
populated as development has risen — and continues to — around the Alewife MBTA
station. The more impervious surfaces that are created, the more stormwater
runoff generated. And making matters worse, intense storms are hitting more
frequently.  On May 22, for example, heavy rain struck parts of Massachusetts in
what forecasters called a late-season nor’easter. Between 6:30 p.m. that day and
1 a.m. the next morning, sewage discharged from the 401A outfall behind the MBTA
parking garage into Alewife Brook.  Through its combined sewer overflow alert
system, the city of Cambridge told the public to avoid contact for 48 hours
because of “increased health risks due to bacteria or other pollutants carried
by the stormwater, such as fertilizers or pesticides.”  In those discharge
instances, “the capacity of that pipe of combined sewage and stormwater is
exceeded,” Hrycyna explained while pointing to the 401A outfall. “And instead of
backing up into the streets or into people’s homes, it’s designed literally to
overflow into a river.”  And yet, sewage can still end up in homes as a result
of flooding, as exemplified by the ordeal at Anderson’s Arlington home.  When
city infrastructure was built in the mid-to-late 1800s, combined sewer outfalls
were widely adopted as best practice, where wastewater and stormwater would
discharge together, out of one pipe, into waterways.  Combined sewer overflows
represent a “legacy of pollution, industrialization and historic infrastructure
systems that no longer work in the cities that we have today,” Copeland said.
However, eliminating combined sewer overflows involves undoing decisions of the
past regarding complicated underground infrastructure — an incredibly costly
endeavor. Progress has certainly been made over the last few decades, but the
issue remains front and center in areas like the Alewife Brook.  According to
the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, of the 86 CSO outfalls active in
the late 1980s in the Boston Harbor area, 45 remain active today. The estimated
annual discharge figure has also decreased from 3.3 billion gallons in the late
1980s to 401 million gallons now.  The most recent variances were issued last
August.  The outcomes of the updated plan, Hiller said, will be a combination of
alternatives aimed at reducing combined sewer overflows. A draft is expected to
be submitted in December, at which time officials will present to the public,
the Department of Environmental Protection and EPA “what we think is feasible in
terms of construction and what is also affordable.”  “It’s definitely not sexy
to talk about sewer and combined sewer overflows,” Hiller said. “And at the end
of the day, this work is expensive, and I know people don’t like talking about
raising taxes. But it comes at a cost. Leaving this region better for our
children and our children’s children is not cheap.”  In Western Massachusetts,
Holyoke will soon begin the $30 million separation of stormwater and wastewater
in a section of the city to reduce pollution of the Connecticut River.  In
September 2023, a judge approved an agreement between the EPA and Holyoke to fix
violations of the Clean Water Act caused by sewer overflows.  ‘Forced exposure
to hazardous sewage’  Other related efforts are occurring simultaneously, both
locally and at the state level.  The Cambridge City Council recently passed a
policy order urging Gov. Maura Healey and the MBTA to rewrite their request for
proposals for the pending redevelopment at the Alewife Station complex to
“ensure that this project plays a central role in ending raw sewage discharges
into Alewife Brook.”  Proposed legislation in front of state lawmakers would
require the effective elimination of combined sewer overflows in the
Massachusetts Water Resource Authority’s service area, by ending the dumping of
untreated sewage during storms considered a 25-year event (the largest storm in
25 years) or smaller — by 2035 at the latest.  Members of Save the Alewife Brook
are eager for the relevant entities and officials to take meaningful action.
They’ve advocated at city council meetings, in front of the state Legislature
and been part of the public comment process for a new long-term control plan.
But they remain skeptical, they said, given the legacy effects of CSOs in the
area.  “These entities could do it, probably some combination of more sewer
separation and tunnel storage and some green infrastructure,” said Gene Benson,
a Save the Alewife Brook member and Arlington resident. “They’re the engineers.
The problem is they don’t have the incentive to go ahead and do it.”  Benson
believes the long-term control plan process is “deeply, deeply flawed.”  “And
that’s why here we are in 2025 and the brook still has, you know, incredible
amount of CSOs going into it every year,” he said. Specifically, the group takes
issue with the use of a “typical year” for data measurements, as years are
becoming less predictable because of climate change, they said.  “This is forced
exposure to hazardous sewage,” Anderson said.   ____________ Photo of Marja

__________________  Raw sewage in Alewife Brook: The unfinished chapter of
Boston Harbor cleanup By Hadley Barndollar | HBarndollar@masslive.com  When the
flood waters receded in the basement of Kristin Anderson’s Arlington home, she
found toilet paper, condoms and tampon applicators strewn throughout, left
behind by the dirty water.  Afterward, she suffered through days of sickness,
namely painful gastrointestinal issues. It was then she realized the Alewife
Brook had quite literally entered her home, and with it, raw sewage.  “It came
right in through the back door after the brook overflowed its banks,” Anderson
recalled. “It was pretty traumatic.”  In Cambridge, where the Alewife Brook
originates, a single outfall pipe located behind the graffiti-laden Alewife MBTA
parking garage is a leading source of sewage discharged into the brook during
periods of heavy rainfall — which data shows are only getting heavier because of
climate change.  It’s an issue that traces back decades to the Boston Harbor
Cleanup case, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency embarked on an
all-hands-on-deck approach to what was, at the time, considered one of the
dirtiest harbors in America.  The court-mandated projects cost more than $4
billion, spurred by two 1980s lawsuits that ultimately led a federal judge to
require the construction of the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant and
supplemental cleanup endeavors.  Today, Boston Harbor is often highlighted as a
national EPA enforcement success story. However, outlying pieces still remain,
such as the sewage issue in the Alewife Brook.  In 2023 alone, 26 million total
gallons of untreated sewage were discharged into the brook, making it the site
of the highest concentration of sewage outfall in the Boston area, according to
the Mystic River Watershed Association.  Data shows about two-thirds of it comes
from the particular outfall labeled by the city of Cambridge as CAM 401A, which
remains noncompliant with the Boston Harbor cleanup plan and sits
inconspicuously on the edge of the Alewife Brook Reservation.  Approximately
5,000 people live in the Alewife Brook’s 100-year flood plain between Cambridge,
Arlington and Belmont. And with the nearby MBTA station and new developments
containing luxury apartments and biotech companies, thousands of people traverse
around the river daily — and specifically, the 401A outfall known to spill over
onto walking paths.  Photos have circulated over the years of a father pushing a
baby stroller through sewage on a path. A young girl riding her bike through
what appears to be rain puddles — but aren’t.  “We aren’t supposed to be coming
into contact with untreated, raw sewage,” said Marja Copeland, stormwater
project manager for the Mystic River Watershed Association.  State-mandated plan
update  The city of Cambridge completed a project in 2013 that separated sewer
and stormwater pipe infrastructure for more than 420 acres. It featured the
creation of the Alewife Stormwater Wetland, a massive nature-based solution for
stormwater management that essentially “pre-treats” stormwater before it flows
into the river.  At that time, it cost more than $150 million. Future sewer
projects in Cambridge — such as pipe separation, sewage storage tanks, tunnels
and more — will certainly surpass that.  And according to the federal Clean
Water Act’s water quality standards, sewage isn’t supposed to be discharged into
Alewife Brook. The state, however, has issued temporary variances to allow it
while the involved parties work toward additional solutions.  Toilet paper and
“floatables” — really anything that is flushed down the toilet — can be seen
buoyant in Alewife Brook during combined sewer overflow (CSO) events. Homeless
encampments had to be moved from the area several times, the individuals
entirely unaware of what they were exposed to when hard rain fell.  “We’re
talking hundreds of millions to billions,” said Lucica Hiller, a senior project
manager for Cambridge’s Department of Public Works. “I think in general we
expect these projects to be funded by water and sewer rates and property taxes.
There’s limited federal funding for this type of work.”  Currently, Cambridge,
Somerville and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) are updating
their long-term controlled sewer overflow plans that were required by the Boston
Harbor federal court case, charting a course for future improvements that will,
they hope, decimate sewer discharge.  The first iteration of the approved plan,
completed in 2015, included 35 projects that cost more than $900 million.
Hrycyna called the sewer overflows into Alewife Brook an example of “the
recalcitrant, last, unfinished chapter of the cleanup of Boston Harbor.”  An
updated long-term control plan was one of the requirements set forth by the
state Department of Environmental Protection when it granted variances from
Clean Water Act standards to permit sewer discharge into the Alewife Brook,
while the MWRA and its partner communities implement solutions.  It’s a public
health concern, but also an ecological one — Alewife Brook is regularly reported
to have some of the worst water quality in the Boston area, affecting the
ability of wildlife to thrive, as well as human recreation.  “The amount of
sewage pollution in that brook, it’s just unfathomable when you look at the size
of it,” said Anderson, the Arlington resident who ultimately formed Save the
Alewife Brook, a grassroots community group of residents working to end sewer
discharge into the river.  What are combined sewer overflows?  On a wet morning
in May, Copeland and her colleague Andy Hrycyna, water quality program manager
for the Mystic River Watershed Association, walked around a MassLive reporter
around Alewife Brook Reservation.  The surrounding area has become densely
populated as development has risen — and continues to — around the Alewife MBTA
station. The more impervious surfaces that are created, the more stormwater
runoff generated. And making matters worse, intense storms are hitting more
frequently.  On May 22, for example, heavy rain struck parts of Massachusetts in
what forecasters called a late-season nor’easter. Between 6:30 p.m. that day and
1 a.m. the next morning, sewage discharged from the 401A outfall behind the MBTA
parking garage into Alewife Brook.  Through its combined sewer overflow alert
system, the city of Cambridge told the public to avoid contact for 48 hours
because of “increased health risks due to bacteria or other pollutants carried
by the stormwater, such as fertilizers or pesticides.”  In those discharge
instances, “the capacity of that pipe of combined sewage and stormwater is
exceeded,” Hrycyna explained while pointing to the 401A outfall. “And instead of
backing up into the streets or into people’s homes, it’s designed literally to
overflow into a river.”  And yet, sewage can still end up in homes as a result
of flooding, as exemplified by the ordeal at Anderson’s Arlington home.  When
city infrastructure was built in the mid-to-late 1800s, combined sewer outfalls
were widely adopted as best practice, where wastewater and stormwater would
discharge together, out of one pipe, into waterways.  Combined sewer overflows
represent a “legacy of pollution, industrialization and historic infrastructure
systems that no longer work in the cities that we have today,” Copeland said.
However, eliminating combined sewer overflows involves undoing decisions of the
past regarding complicated underground infrastructure — an incredibly costly
endeavor. Progress has certainly been made over the last few decades, but the
issue remains front and center in areas like the Alewife Brook.  According to
the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, of the 86 CSO outfalls active in
the late 1980s in the Boston Harbor area, 45 remain active today. The estimated
annual discharge figure has also decreased from 3.3 billion gallons in the late
1980s to 401 million gallons now.  The most recent variances were issued last
August.  The outcomes of the updated plan, Hiller said, will be a combination of
alternatives aimed at reducing combined sewer overflows. A draft is expected to
be submitted in December, at which time officials will present to the public,
the Department of Environmental Protection and EPA “what we think is feasible in
terms of construction and what is also affordable.”  “It’s definitely not sexy
to talk about sewer and combined sewer overflows,” Hiller said. “And at the end
of the day, this work is expensive, and I know people don’t like talking about
raising taxes. But it comes at a cost. Leaving this region better for our
children and our children’s children is not cheap.”  In Western Massachusetts,
Holyoke will soon begin the $30 million separation of stormwater and wastewater
in a section of the city to reduce pollution of the Connecticut River.  In
September 2023, a judge approved an agreement between the EPA and Holyoke to fix
violations of the Clean Water Act caused by sewer overflows.  ‘Forced exposure
to hazardous sewage’  Other related efforts are occurring simultaneously, both
locally and at the state level.  The Cambridge City Council recently passed a
policy order urging Gov. Maura Healey and the MBTA to rewrite their request for
proposals for the pending redevelopment at the Alewife Station complex to
“ensure that this project plays a central role in ending raw sewage discharges
into Alewife Brook.”  Proposed legislation in front of state lawmakers would
require the effective elimination of combined sewer overflows in the
Massachusetts Water Resource Authority’s service area, by ending the dumping of
untreated sewage during storms considered a 25-year event (the largest storm in
25 years) or smaller — by 2035 at the latest.  Members of Save the Alewife Brook
are eager for the relevant entities and officials to take meaningful action.
They’ve advocated at city council meetings, in front of the state Legislature
and been part of the public comment process for a new long-term control plan.
But they remain skeptical, they said, given the legacy effects of CSOs in the
area.  “These entities could do it, probably some combination of more sewer
separation and tunnel storage and some green infrastructure,” said Gene Benson,
a Save the Alewife Brook member and Arlington resident. “They’re the engineers.
The problem is they don’t have the incentive to go ahead and do it.”  Benson
believes the long-term control plan process is “deeply, deeply flawed.”  “And
that’s why here we are in 2025 and the brook still has, you know, incredible
amount of CSOs going into it every year,” he said. Specifically, the group takes
issue with the use of a “typical year” for data measurements, as years are
becoming less predictable because of climate change, they said.  “This is forced
exposure to hazardous sewage,” Anderson said.   ____________ Photo of Marja

1kg44sk,North East Corridor Report from Transit Costs,"Some Highlights:  Relevant to commuter rail:  * Frequent all-day service, rather
than just at rush hour, with more regular stopping patterns * Mode-neutral
fares, charging the same as urban rail within the city, and allowing free
transfers with buses in the suburbs * More stations within the city, or at least
not skipping the existing urban stations on most trains * Electrification of all
lines, and the purchase of new modern, self-propelled trains
(so-called *electric multiple units* or *EMUs*) * High platforms at all
stations, to enable fast, wheelchair-accessible boarding  &gt;Moreover,
electrification and high platforms both substantially increase speed and
reliability: our schedule for the Providence Line, using EMUs and high-platform
stations, shortens the Boston-Providence local trip time to 47 minutes from
today’s 72. This is crucial for intercity rail improvements: speeding up the
slower trains makes it easier to timetable the faster trains on shared track.  #
Policy Recommendations  &gt;Our proposal is based on integration of
infrastructure planning, schedule planning, and rolling stock and other
technical standards. As such, our recommendations start from a better framework
for allowing such planning. Policymakers must be ready to address all of the
following points to make the most of the NEC and allow low-cost high-speed rail
service on it.  &gt;**Coordinate planning NEC-wide**  &gt;The federal government
and state agencies must establish a coordinating planning body for the NEC, with
the authority to plan schedules, infrastructure, and rolling stock purchases.
This necessarily reduces the autonomy of each agency using the NEC, but in truth
they are all deriving their funding from the same pot of FRA money for NEC
improvements. There already is some coordination in the form of projects like
NEC Future and now Connect
2035,[^(\[17\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n17) which
essentially staple together different agency wishlists. To build high-speed rail
on the NEC for $17 billion rather than $110 billion, it is necessary to go
further with this coordination and instead build an integrated Northeastern Takt
timetable, binding Amtrak and all commuter rail agencies.  &gt;**Adopt best
standards for systems and rolling stock**  &gt;The best standards are well
within American regulations in 2025, but are not within the American railroading
tradition. These include lightly modified European equipment, modern
implementations of such systems as turnouts and catenary, and lower-cost ways of
delivering projects as we’ve recommended for subway
construction.[^(\[18\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n18) It
is particularly important to learn how to make the most of the higher
performance specifications of modern equipment, including not just imported
European trainsets but also back-of-the-house equipment like track laying
machines. In the medium run, American railroad agencies should send their mid-
and early-career staff to foreign conferences and symposiums to learn best
practices and assimilate them domestically.  &gt;**Fund the Connect 2035
projects required for high-speed schedules**  &gt;Among the projects under
discussion but not yet funded, there are ones that stand out as necessary to
build. The federal government should fund them immediately, using remaining
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds. They may be critical enough that even
without federal funding, state funding may be cost-effective.  &gt;The most
important of those are the NJ Transit capacity improvements: Hunter Flyover, the
Mid-Line Loop, and the mid-level movable version of the Portal South Bridge,
which are projected to cost a total of $1.7 billion in 2024 prices. A grade
separation of New Rochelle, at CP 216, is required as well and if anything more
important than Hunter and Mid-Line, but is at an earlier stage of development,
whereas the NJ Transit projects are ready for BIL construction funding.
&gt;**Deprioritize Penn Expansion and other projects that can be avoided through
better timetabling**  &gt;The largest items on the Connect 2035 list are the
expansion of New York Penn Station and its reconstruction. These do not further
this goal of coordinated timetabling and should not proceed. The infrastructure
investment section gives some details; for more details, see ETA’s report and
simulations of Penn
Station.[^(\[19\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n19) A
handful of Penn Reconstruction vertical circulation work is prudent, but is a
small fraction of the overall project, which lacks any itemized costs allowing
the public or even the FRA to review its budget breakdown.  &gt;**Remove State
of Good Repair from the list of projects**  &gt;Funding bridge replacements and
state of good repair (SOGR) out of a pot of money designed for a megaproject
leads to bloat, and designing a common capital program for both long-term
maintenance and expansion leads to a program that works poorly for both.
Megaprojects are inherently risky, and extravagant definitions of the projects
decided long before any public debate are
routine.[^(\[20\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n20) The
one factor limiting cost growth is that they are flashy and the public comes to
expect that the megaproject, such as a high-speed rail line or a subway line,
will open. Maintenance and renewal lack this limit, and can only work if funded
on an ongoing basis, based on regular performance metrics. SOGR in effect weds
the worst problems of megaprojects (cost overruns) with the worst problems of
non-megaproject investment (lack of visible progress checking the project).
&gt;Indeed, one can compare Connecticut’s SOGR program with rail renewal
programs in Germany. Connecticut spent $700-900 million a year on rail
infrastructure and equipment in
2017-21,[^(\[21\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n21) or
about $990 million in 2024 prices, for a network comprising about 780 track-km
(485 track-miles) and 370 route-km (230 route-miles). The long-term renewal of
the Hanover-Würzburg line, required once in several decades (the line opened in
1991), was 850 million
euros,[^(\[22\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n22) or
$1.43 billion in 2024 prices, for 327 route-km of which 120 are in tunnel, or
654 track-km (406 track-miles). Once in a generation renewal in Germany costs
only 70% more than the annual infrastructure cost in Connecticut, where renewal
is a never-ending process in which at any point in time, some section of the New
Haven Line is out of service and many are under slow orders.  &gt;In lieu of the
failed SOGR program, we recommend that maintenance be funded on the same rolling
basis as operations, and that methods be realigned with best practices,
including highly mechanized trackwork using track laying machines working an
entire section at once rather than labor-intensive manual inspections of the
fixed plant.  &gt;**Add strategic bypasses to the Connect 2035 list and begin
design work on them immediately**  &gt;There are projects on the Connect 2035
list that we recommend moving forward with and ones we recommend canceling. Then
there are projects not on the list, or heavily modified from the list, that
should be built. These are high priorities for planning, as they are in a less
advanced state than the already approved projects just waiting for funding.
&gt;These include all of the bypasses that we outline, including not just the $5
billion New Haven-Kingston bypass, but also $5 billion in New Haven Line
bypasses described in the high-investment scenario. In a low-investment
scenario, it is likely that only the New Haven-Kingston bypass deserves to be
funded for construction, as it saves 32 minutes whereas the New Haven Line
bypasses save 7 minutes for about the same cost. However, it is better to
preplan projects and then see how much money is available in capital expansion
funding than to scramble for planning funds when money becomes
available.[^(\[23\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n23)
&gt;This also includes a Cos Cob Bridge replacement. The replacement planned is
not a critical project, and is excessively expensive at $4.25 billion for less
than 2 kilometers (a little more than a mile) of
trackwork.[^(\[24\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n24) Ordinarily,
we would call for cancellation, as we do elsewhere. However, an alternative
alignment incorporating rebuilding the bridge would ease some short, sharp
curves, and is included, with suggestions for how to use more modern rail
standards to reduce costs.",25,"infrastructure, stations, metrolink, platforms, corridor, planning, track, concrete, tunnel, electrification","25: infrastructure, stations, metrolink, platforms, corridor, planning, track, concrete, tunnel, electrification","North East Corridor Report from Transit Costs Some Highlights:  Relevant to commuter rail:  * Frequent all-day service, rather

small fraction of the overall project, which lacks any itemized costs allowing
the public or even the FRA to review its budget breakdown.  &gt;**Remove State
of Good Repair from the list of projects**  &gt;Funding bridge replacements and
state of good repair (SOGR) out of a pot of money designed for a megaproject
leads to bloat, and designing a common capital program for both long-term
maintenance and expansion leads to a program that works poorly for both.
Megaprojects are inherently risky, and extravagant definitions of the projects
decided long before any public debate are
routine.[^(\[20\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n20) The
one factor limiting cost growth is that they are flashy and the public comes to
expect that the megaproject, such as a high-speed rail line or a subway line,
will open. Maintenance and renewal lack this limit, and can only work if funded
on an ongoing basis, based on regular performance metrics. SOGR in effect weds
the worst problems of megaprojects (cost overruns) with the worst problems of
non-megaproject investment (lack of visible progress checking the project).
&gt;Indeed, one can compare Connecticut’s SOGR program with rail renewal
programs in Germany. Connecticut spent $700-900 million a year on rail
infrastructure and equipment in
2017-21,[^(\[21\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n21) or
about $990 million in 2024 prices, for a network comprising about 780 track-km
(485 track-miles) and 370 route-km (230 route-miles). The long-term renewal of
the Hanover-Würzburg line, required once in several decades (the line opened in
1991), was 850 million
euros,[^(\[22\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n22) or
$1.43 billion in 2024 prices, for 327 route-km of which 120 are in tunnel, or
654 track-km (406 track-miles). Once in a generation renewal in Germany costs
only 70% more than the annual infrastructure cost in Connecticut, where renewal
is a never-ending process in which at any point in time, some section of the New
Haven Line is out of service and many are under slow orders.  &gt;In lieu of the
failed SOGR program, we recommend that maintenance be funded on the same rolling
basis as operations, and that methods be realigned with best practices,
including highly mechanized trackwork using track laying machines working an
entire section at once rather than labor-intensive manual inspections of the
fixed plant.  &gt;**Add strategic bypasses to the Connect 2035 list and begin
design work on them immediately**  &gt;There are projects on the Connect 2035
list that we recommend moving forward with and ones we recommend canceling. Then
there are projects not on the list, or heavily modified from the list, that
should be built. These are high priorities for planning, as they are in a less
advanced state than the already approved projects just waiting for funding.
&gt;These include all of the bypasses that we outline, including not just the $5
billion New Haven-Kingston bypass, but also $5 billion in New Haven Line
bypasses described in the high-investment scenario. In a low-investment
scenario, it is likely that only the New Haven-Kingston bypass deserves to be
funded for construction, as it saves 32 minutes whereas the New Haven Line
bypasses save 7 minutes for about the same cost. However, it is better to
preplan projects and then see how much money is available in capital expansion
funding than to scramble for planning funds when money becomes
available.[^(\[23\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n23)
&gt;This also includes a Cos Cob Bridge replacement. The replacement planned is
not a critical project, and is excessively expensive at $4.25 billion for less
than 2 kilometers (a little more than a mile) of
trackwork.[^(\[24\])](https://transitcosts.com/north-east-corridor-report/#n24) Ordinarily,
we would call for cancellation, as we do elsewhere. However, an alternative
alignment incorporating rebuilding the bridge would ease some short, sharp
curves, and is included, with suggestions for how to use more modern rail
standards to reduce costs.",0.010350148193538189,0.6410720944404602,0.34857773780822754,0.33822759985923767

Greater Boston is a region of big ideas. The MBTA, however, isn’t thinking big
enough.  Massachusetts lacks a coherent strategy for its transit future. Without
it, construction costs will keep rising, congestion will worsen, and housing
development will continue to be shaped by today’s transit map – locking in car
dependency for generations.  The state keeps solving yesterday’s problems
instead of anticipating tomorrow’s needs. A world-class transit system drives
business investment, increases property values and unlocks commercial growth.
But we’re letting short-term funding limitations dictate our region’s future.
The result? A region struggling with some of the worst traffic congestion in the
country and a housing crisis exacerbated by poor transit access.  # Planning
Saves Money  A city and region this wealthy should have a transit system that
meets people where they live.  That means fully electrified, high-frequency
regional rail. It means robust bus service, not just in the core but in the
suburbs, where development pressures are shifting. It means aligning transit
investment with real estate development and ensuring businesses and housing are
built around transit – projects like Boston Landing and Assembly Row have shown
that this is successful.  The Green Line Extension (GLX) was a bespoke project
from an agency that hadn’t built a major rapid transit extension in three
decades, and the price tag reflected this.  GLX lingered in planning limbo for
30 years, accumulating cost and complexity. Meanwhile, Montreal planned, funded,
and opened the first 10 miles of an automated light metro system – the REM – at
a fraction of the GLX’s per-mile cost in 8 years.  That’s the difference between
a long-term vision and lurching from project to project. Other regions are
reaping the benefits of sustained investment.  # CRE Loses Out Without T Vision
We’re already paying the price for the MBTA’s lack of planning.  Municipalities
make land-use decisions based on today’s transit network, locking in car
dependency for decades. A missing rail station or a slow bus connection might
not seem like a big deal, but these gaps shape where people live and work.  The
result is predictable: too little housing near reliable transit, too much
sprawl, and clogged roads. For the CRE industry, this presents a real challenge:
commercial and mixed-use developments thrive in areas with transit connectivity,
but the state isn’t giving investors the certainty they need.  The Fairmount
Line electrification pilot is a rare bright spot – a sign of what’s possible
when we think ahead. But it’s also a reminder of how much work remains. While
Toronto is delivering nearly 20 miles of light rail, a 5-mile subway extension
and a revamped commuter rail system with electrified service every 15 minutes,
Boston is still debating what kind of system it needs instead of committing to a
vision.  Transit expansion is an investment strategy – one that directly
benefits the CRE industry. Well-planned transit increases property values,
stabilizes commercial markets, and provides long-term resilience. But
Massachusetts treats it as an afterthought, which is why we keep falling behind.
# What the T Needs  We need a commitment to long-term transit expansion, not
just reactive projects driven by short-term funding.  This means bold,
forward-looking choices – prioritizing regional rail electrification, infill
stations and frequent, all-day service across the MBTA network. It also means a
structured plan – one that developers, businesses and municipalities can rely
on.  Over the next five years, Massachusetts should expand electrification
pilots and implement transit-oriented zoning reforms to lay the groundwork for
future growth. Within 10 to 15 years, we must move beyond incremental
improvements and commit to full regional rail electrification while establishing
dedicated funding sources.  Over the next three decades, the goal should be a
transit network enabling car-free living at scale – reshaping where people live
and work, strengthening the state’s economic competitiveness, and ensuring
Greater Boston remains a leader in sustainable urban development.  For all of
Massachusetts’ political divisions, transit is one of the few areas of
widespread agreement. Leaders acknowledge traffic congestion is unsustainable,
housing costs are out of control and better transit options are needed. The
challenge is turning that understanding into action.  For CRE professionals,
this means engaging early in transit planning – pushing municipalities to adopt
transit-oriented zoning, advocating for state investment in transit corridors
and ensuring that the next decade of development is built around transit, not
auto-centricity.  # We Can’t Afford a Wish List  The MBTA has a long-range plan
in development. That’s a start.  But we can’t afford another bureaucratic
exercise that results in a wish list without commitment or a vague plan with no
timeline, funding strategy, or private sector engagement.  The plan needs to be
realistic but ambitious. It must address the scale of the region’s challenges
and be proactive, not just a list of projects that might happen if funding
appears someday.  The risks of inaction are too great: falling behind peer
cities, worsening congestion and stunted housing production. But the
opportunities are enormous. A well-planned, well-funded transit network could
transform how people live and work across Greater Boston.  The commercial real
estate industry has a vested interest in a functional transit system. CRE
leaders should be vocal in pushing for ambitious transit expansion – because the
health of their investments and the strength of the region’s economy depend on
it.  We have the chance to build something lasting. Now is the time to seize it.

1dzklpb,"The MBTA is facing a crisis, so I am doing something about it by planning to host an event to bring attention.","For too long, the state of Massachusetts has failed to provide support to the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Ever since the change in the
financial backing via a sales tax system that did not keep up with the changing
times in the 2000s, the MBTA has slowly began to fall apart.   We have seen
fires on trains. We have seen the death of people who should still be alive by
now. We have seen projects that have been continuously being delayed, letting
communities down that rely on the MBTA. We have seen multiple derailments. We
are seeing a 700 million dollar deficit for the budget for next fiscal year.
Service has been a major problem over the last couple of years. An increase of
slow zones until the implementation of the Track Improvement Program, aging
infrastructure, and bad headways combine for service that is not what we
deserve. We should not be waiting upwards of 20 minutes for an outbound train to
Braintree or Ashmont. We should have better communication for meetings (such as
the South Coast Rail meeting that only was announced the day before) or when a
line goes down (like today with the Red Line).  The people of Boston deserve
better. Low income families deserve better. People of color in Boston deserve
better. The greater Boston area deserves better.   That is why today, I am
announcing that I will be working on an event that will hopefully bring
attention to this crisis. I want to bring awareness to the fact that people
should care about the potential impact of the MBTA shutting down in the next
couple of years. To do this, I would like to have speakers talk about their
experiences with the MBTA, pass out flyers to riders about the issues that the
MBTA is facing and how the state government has not responded to these concerns,
and call out state legislators and Governor Healey to actually make funding the
MBTA a major priority in the next legislative session.  Some may say that the
MBTA should just fail, that it is an embarrassment, that we, as the MBTA
community, are a bunch of “defenders of a bad system”. I say this: many people
that you rely on use the MBTA as their only source of transportation. Without
the MBTA, thousands of people will lose access to their jobs, healthcare,
education, food/clothing, government services, and the things that we rely on to
live. Traffic will become unbearable at a time where we are known for having the
worst traffic in the United States, especially during games/events at Fenway or
TD Garden. Less people are going to head to Boston as a result, causing a
slowing economy in Boston and in turn Massachusetts. College students will begin
not considering Boston as a place to study or live in, one of the biggest
population and fuelers of said economy. Tourism will begin to suffer because
tourists will have to rely on Ubers and cabs that will inevitably become very
expensive because the demand for them will increase to a point where very few
people will be able to get one or afford them. Services like BlueBikes will
suffer the same issues because there will be not enough bikes to meet demand.
Low-income families will not have any other way to feed their families or
support them. People will leave Massachusetts in droves because people will get
fed up with all of the issues I just mentioned here.  For those who would like
to help support, please let me know.

1d19apj,Green Line Updates,"So, in my personal opinion, the green line is *by far* the worst line of the 4
major lines. There's just so many problems with it:  1. Obviously, the slow
zones that plague the MBTA as a whole, particularly the green and red lines. 2.
It has such frequent stops that it spends a ton of time in station,
accelerating, and decelerating, which adds up, and a ton of the stops are super
redundant. 3. It's light rail, which means that even when the track is free from
slow zones and it does manage to get up to max speed before having to slow down
for the next station, it's significantly slower than the other lines. 4. Parts
of it come above ground and aren't fully separated from the street, meaning you
have to wait *in traffic* on a *train*, which is just absurd. 5. It has 4
separate branches, which makes it so that you have to wait so much longer to get
any train if you're past Kenmore, or for the right train if you're before
Kenmore but want to get past it. Plus, there's so many trains once you get past
Kenmore that they always have to wait to actually get into the station! (And
obviously the additional split at Copley makes it that much worse in addition to
the Kenmore split.)  The first one is currently being worked on, and I can't
imagine the second would be too difficult to change, but the rest seem a lot
more difficult to fix. Obviously, it's literally the oldest subway system in the
country, and while having that title is nice, I'd much rather have quality over
history. It being outdated for a bit is understandable, but eventually, it
should really be updated. Surely, we shouldn't have to deal with the green line
constantly being miles behind the other lines just because it was built first
forever, right? Does anyone here know how feasible it would be to actually
update it significantly, ideally including points 3,  and 5, especially 3? Or

people understand that the Red Line issues are combination of factors: bad
track, old trains.  While Eng promises improvement to the track by the end of

1c0yhy2,LET’s TALK ABOUT: Missing transit links in nearby cities and Op-Ed piece about more transit options in Watertown,"EDIT: This post has been reposted due to an error I made mixed Co-ed with Op-ed
due to a user pointing this out. I appreciate this and apologize for this
incorrect terminology.  This is a Op-ed that Guest Writer Mark Pickering wrote
about the need for more bus and transit options in Watertown. I want to first
highlight some important ideas  - “…Levity aside, the plan to send the No. 71
buses across the river to the MBTA’s Watertown Yard sounds like a bad idea. It
puts more traffic on the narrow bridge and accomplishes pretty much nothing, as
far as transportation goes. Looking at the big picture, two parts of the
Watertown transit system work reasonably well. That would be the No. 71 bus to
Harvard Square and the Mass Pike. The current Watertown Square redesign plan
sends the No. 71 over the river, with no dedicated bus lanes. That would add
even more of traffic to the bridge and, to some degree, undermine the No. 71
service”.  - “The No. 70 is the missing link in the current Watertown Square
plan, which ignores this connection entirely. The big picture here: No
reasonable person would look at the No. 70 route and see it as a bus line. It
goes through some of the worst traffic bottlenecks in Greater Boston including
the Charles River mess where Mass. Pike ramps, local traffic, Storrow Drive and
Memorial Drive all crash together”.  - “The bus route does, however, look more
like an extension of the Red Line. If the MBTA got going on that right away,
that would make a lot of sense.  - “Now, there’s money available for new
projects that was not there before. That’s because the so-called Millionaires
Tax creates a new pool of money, hopefully to fix Massachusetts transit woes.
Watertown deserves to be at the top of the list for getting that cash”.  - “In
contrast, when the MBTA tore down the elevated Orange Line, Roxbury got some
stops on the new Orange Line and numerous dedicated bus lanes heading into
Dudley Station. The state and the MBTA are to blame for Watertown’s woeful
public transit service. They need to ante up”.  When it comes to regional
transit, areas such as Weymouth, Braintree/Milton, Watertown, and Lynn deserves
more bus service and, hopefully, subway expansions that better serve these
communities and help free the housing hellscape that is Boston by adding more
rapid transit aside from the Commuter Rail. It will add more transit-orienting
housing (like what the Malden-Everett-Chelsea area has been able to do) and
provide thousands of new jobs for everyone. Adding more bus-only lanes and
improving bus infrastructure can help with this, but this should be coming from
the state first, with the T helping to make these things actually happen  (when
the T gets back on its’ feet).  What do y’all think about my thoughts and the

because it should save me time compared to the T, but this isn't the only time
it's been delayed. I think this was the absolute worst I've experienced, but
I've also experienced delays of 30+ minutes where most of the people waiting for
the CR give up and get on the RL.   Was anyone else there? And if anyone could
chime in about what we can do to begin to advocate for improved service, that'd
be great. I've only lived in Boston for 1.5 years and the bureaucracy is
extremely (and probably intentionally) difficult to navigate.",0.8765212297439575,0.11480284482240677,0.008675933815538883,-0.8678452968597412
18c4glr,Seems like the orange line is the worst when it comes to random men harassing women and children,"Yesterday evening it was a man whose eyes were bloodshot and was slurring his
words bothering a couple caregivers with their two small children. I felt bad
witnessing them just gray rock him til hopefully they could get to their
destination without needing to respond more seriously. But eventually one of
them just straight up told him it was enough, to not speak to children and to
leave them alone. That was before a bunch of other people boarded too, at which
point he turned his attention to any other woman he could bother.  I think he
had tried to speak to me at one point but I had my earbuds in, I ignored him, I
ended up pausing my music and turning off the noise cancelation surreptitiously
to be able to intervene if necessary.  Also he borderline assaulted a woman
leaving the train at downtown crossing, he’d shoved his way through the crowd of
people in the subway car at the last minute before the doors closed and in the
process literally had his arm around a woman’s neck briefly as he exited — not
that it was intentional but he obviously didn’t care either, people literally
gasped collectively.  With few exceptions I won’t proactively interfere in a
scenario like that, of someone harassing others on the T, if it hasn’t already
escalated, e.g. they’re able to brush him off while they can. For example once
an elderly man with a cane was sitting next to women and asking them for money
repeatedly, by the third person I just told him to stop harassing women and that
I was so close to calling the cops on him, it worked in that situation. But
obviously I’m not going to insert myself in a situation where it could make
things unsafe, hope that goes without saying.  If anyone needs mace they sell it
at the army/navy store downtown, I don’t leave my house without it. It’s only a
few times a year at most that I ever feel like I might need to actually use it
to protect myself because there are enough loose cannons in Boston.  Anyone have
similar stories? Is there a way to alert mbta personnel quietly when something

reconfigure Sullivan Square itself, with (hopefully!) more mixed-use development

has a lot of potential to carry much more traffic as a true MBTA modal hub. As

is mostly not fixable lol  2. There is no direct connection to the adjacent

18wvq49,What is the future of the MBTA and how can we support it?,"Hello, dear riders!  I am an 18M year old psychology student at UMass Boston and
I am really interested in how we got to the situation that the T is in.
Obviously the major issue is the lack of funding from cities and the state as a
whole and horrible leadership that failed to address the issues that the system
is experiencing. Even now, with all of the improvements we have seen in terms of
faster trains on the Red and Green Lines, the T still has a gauntlet of problems
that needs to be dealt before the system is in a good state of repairs.  The Big
Dig is another major issue since the state basically stole millions of dollars
from the T for a program that has not been able to address the increasing demand
of traffic.  However, if I was head of the T, here is what I would plan for the
next couple of years, based on lines:  RED LINE: - Accelerate the deployment of
the new CRRC trains that has been waited on for a decade. All of the trains were
supposed to be implemented in 2023 yet we have seen continuous delays due to
Cabot Yard work that should’ve been done while the cars were deployed. -
Renovate old stations (Shawmut, UMass, Andrew, Broadway, etc) to keep them up to
date. - Improve outbound train departures so that riders do not have to wait for
an Ashmont or Braintreee train for up to 20-25 minutes or for Alewife trains to
come every 15 minutes on the Ashmont/Braintree branches.  GREEN LINE: - Order

trains are not stopping every 2 minutes like a bus and so stations are actually
being used. - Make stations on the E branch accessible past Brigham Circle so

trains from incoming traffic. - Implement priority signals for trains so that
they do not have to wait for traffic (like how LA Metro does theirs). - Renovate
Hynes, Symphony, etc.  ORANGE LINES - Fix the slow zone between Sullivan and
BHCC. - Renovate stations past Back Bay (many are starting to show their time
and are extremely ugly/outdated or possibly dangerous) - Extend to Melrose and
Roslindale/W. Roxbury while trying to not raise property prices in the area
(which would inevitably happen).  BLUE LINE: - Make new trains for the Blue Line
to keep them up to date. - Renovate stations Suffolk Downs up to Revere Beach. -

Extend the line westward if time and money permits.  SILVER LINE -Make this a
radial line so that downtown stations are not packed during rush hours (State,
PS, GC, and DC). - Make this a subway line to reestablish transit to Nubian,
Everett, and City Point. - Use old Blue Line trains while planning new trains.

are being monitored by the FTA yet still having near-death situations that
should not be happening).  CR (REGIONAL RAIL) - Electrify the system. - Extend
the D line to Auburndale to have immediate access to the CR station. - Place a
CR station at Medford/Tufts so that GLX riders do not have to go to N. Station

I am really interested in how we got to the situation that the T is in.
Obviously the major issue is the lack of funding from cities and the state as a
whole and horrible leadership that failed to address the issues that the system
is experiencing. Even now, with all of the improvements we have seen in terms of
faster trains on the Red and Green Lines, the T still has a gauntlet of problems
that needs to be dealt before the system is in a good state of repairs.  The Big
Dig is another major issue since the state basically stole millions of dollars
from the T for a program that has not been able to address the increasing demand
of traffic.  However, if I was head of the T, here is what I would plan for the
next couple of years, based on lines:  RED LINE: - Accelerate the deployment of
the new CRRC trains that has been waited on for a decade. All of the trains were
supposed to be implemented in 2023 yet we have seen continuous delays due to
Cabot Yard work that should’ve been done while the cars were deployed. -
Renovate old stations (Shawmut, UMass, Andrew, Broadway, etc) to keep them up to
date. - Improve outbound train departures so that riders do not have to wait for
an Ashmont or Braintreee train for up to 20-25 minutes or for Alewife trains to
come every 15 minutes on the Ashmont/Braintree branches.  GREEN LINE: - Order
more Type 9 trains and wait to implement Type 10s until the near future so that
trains are updated while waiting to accommodate the needed changes to use the
Type 10 trains. - Consolidate stations on the B, C, and E branches so that
trains are not stopping every 2 minutes like a bus and so stations are actually

1i1qxup,Why I Hate the CRRC Trains: A Motorman's Perspective,"I thought you guys might find this interesting. Here's a list of all the reasons
why I, as a Red Line Motorman, hate the CRRC trains.   In no particular order:
- The passenger seats are uncomfortable. - Not enough seating in the cars, tons
of open space. I know we're trying for accessibility but I feel like it's too
much. What about people who are elderly or injured who need a seat? - The GMD
button is SUPER easy to accidentally press. It happens constantly, and every
single time it does, the motorman has to walk back to that car to make sure no
one needs assistance. - The GMD is a completely useless feature. It doesn't take
the platform's elevation into account, just sticks straight out. It is also
EXTREMELY slow to deploy and only functions in the head car. It is literally
faster and more useful to get a bridgeplate in every situation imaginable.  -
The software behind the destination signs have no functionality to input
anything other than terminus stations. This is extremely confusing for
passengers during diversions.  - The automatic announcements always say the
doors will open on ""the left, or right"" when coming into Alewife or Braintree.
I, as the motorman, know which side the doors will open on well before we enter
the station because I can see how the switch is set. There is a button on the
announcement interface to pick which side it says the doors will open on. That
button does nothing.  - There is an error with the automatic announcements that
pops up sometimes that also prevents me from using the PA to make manual
announcements. So when that happens, we just have no announcements I guess. -
There are a million false and redundant error codes that show up on the MTU,
which obfuscates the important ones.  - The doors are extremely slow to close. -
THE BEEPING. THE ENDLESS BEEPING. DEAR GOD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP. - You can't use
""the slide"" to berth at stations- the train will harshly jolt and dump its air.
No fun at all. -  The tinted windows in the motorman's cab block the ability to
utilize the station mirrors if you didn't stop in the EXACT right spot. They
also dampen my beautiful skyline view on the Longfellow bridge.  - The
windshield wipers are positioned in a really annoying spot that partially blocks
my view of the track. And they don't even wipe the whole windshield, only like
1/3rd of it. - The coat hook is positioned right in front of the cab door, so if
I hang my coat or bag there I literally can't open the door without moving it. -
The hostler car significantly reduces redundancy for when there are inevitable
mechanical failures. -  When doing an emergency stop at 40mph, the wheels go
flat.  - The circuit breaker panel is locked with a maintenance key that
motormen are not issued. So I literally can't reset anything on this train. This
is something motormen are expected to do when problems arise, and they actually
prevented us from being able to do it. Genius.   I'm probably forgetting some,
I'll edit this post if I can think of more. These trains REALLY suck. Even so,
more new trains can't come fast enough- it is absolutely deplorable that we're
running multiple trains with out-of-service cars DURING RUSH HOUR because we
have no functional equipment. I'll take what I can get, damn it.  Edit to add
more stuff, in case anyone's still reading this: - The ledge you use to climb on
the front of the train is EXTREMELY narrow. It is legitimately scary- and I say
this as a small person with small feet. - The train is filled to the brim with
cameras, including one on the rear of the train for backing up, with a viewing
screen in the cab. Great idea! Except there is no way to interface with the
screen, so I can't pull up my 5th car to check a report of someone smoking in
there, or pull up the rearview camera if I overshoot the station. The screen
just cycles through all the cameras uselessly. - The headlights are a circle of
LED bulbs, and for low beams the bottom half lights up, and for high beams the
top half lights up. This design makes it so that the low beams don't show you
enough distance, and the high beams are at a weird useless angle and aren't any
brighter than the low beams. - The pilot lights being grouped in pairs make them
extremely difficult to discern when berthed on platforms that lack a generous
curve- they blend together.  *All opinions shared are solely my own. I do not
speak for or represent the MBTA in any way.*",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"Why I Hate the CRRC Trains: A Motorman's Perspective I thought you guys might find this interesting. Here's a list of all the reasons

single time it does, the motorman has to walk back to that car to make sure no
one needs assistance. - The GMD is a completely useless feature. It doesn't take
the platform's elevation into account, just sticks straight out. It is also
EXTREMELY slow to deploy and only functions in the head car. It is literally
faster and more useful to get a bridgeplate in every situation imaginable.  -
The software behind the destination signs have no functionality to input
anything other than terminus stations. This is extremely confusing for
passengers during diversions.  - The automatic announcements always say the
doors will open on ""the left, or right"" when coming into Alewife or Braintree.
I, as the motorman, know which side the doors will open on well before we enter
the station because I can see how the switch is set. There is a button on the
announcement interface to pick which side it says the doors will open on. That
button does nothing.  - There is an error with the automatic announcements that
pops up sometimes that also prevents me from using the PA to make manual
announcements. So when that happens, we just have no announcements I guess. -
There are a million false and redundant error codes that show up on the MTU,
which obfuscates the important ones.  - The doors are extremely slow to close. -
THE BEEPING. THE ENDLESS BEEPING. DEAR GOD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP. - You can't use
""the slide"" to berth at stations- the train will harshly jolt and dump its air.
No fun at all. -  The tinted windows in the motorman's cab block the ability to
utilize the station mirrors if you didn't stop in the EXACT right spot. They
also dampen my beautiful skyline view on the Longfellow bridge.  - The
windshield wipers are positioned in a really annoying spot that partially blocks
my view of the track. And they don't even wipe the whole windshield, only like
1/3rd of it. - The coat hook is positioned right in front of the cab door, so if
I hang my coat or bag there I literally can't open the door without moving it. -
The hostler car significantly reduces redundancy for when there are inevitable
mechanical failures. -  When doing an emergency stop at 40mph, the wheels go
flat.  - The circuit breaker panel is locked with a maintenance key that
motormen are not issued. So I literally can't reset anything on this train. This
is something motormen are expected to do when problems arise, and they actually
prevented us from being able to do it. Genius.   I'm probably forgetting some,
I'll edit this post if I can think of more. These trains REALLY suck. Even so,
more new trains can't come fast enough- it is absolutely deplorable that we're
running multiple trains with out-of-service cars DURING RUSH HOUR because we
have no functional equipment. I'll take what I can get, damn it.  Edit to add
more stuff, in case anyone's still reading this: - The ledge you use to climb on
the front of the train is EXTREMELY narrow. It is legitimately scary- and I say
this as a small person with small feet. - The train is filled to the brim with
cameras, including one on the rear of the train for backing up, with a viewing
screen in the cab. Great idea! Except there is no way to interface with the
screen, so I can't pull up my 5th car to check a report of someone smoking in
there, or pull up the rearview camera if I overshoot the station. The screen
just cycles through all the cameras uselessly. - The headlights are a circle of
LED bulbs, and for low beams the bottom half lights up, and for high beams the
top half lights up. This design makes it so that the low beams don't show you
enough distance, and the high beams are at a weird useless angle and aren't any
brighter than the low beams. - The pilot lights being grouped in pairs make them
extremely difficult to discern when berthed on platforms that lack a generous
curve- they blend together.  *All opinions shared are solely my own. I do not
speak for or represent the MBTA in any way.*",0.8059828877449036,0.17883454263210297,0.015182594768702984,-0.7908002734184265

18robrt,N/S rail link simplification,"Everything I'm proposing is disregarding political or beurocratic obstacles.
Could the rail link be constructed as shown above? My thought process is that
the reserve bank building is far enough right there is room to run the tracks
past it (with measures to assure foundational stability) and all that would be
taken out would be a parking lot. Additionally, since there was previously a
track running underneath the main concourse, it is clearly possible for the
platforms to be lower. It would require a rebuild of south station similar to
the one in 1989, which would be very expensive yes, but I think considering the
current plan to tunnel bore several very long, deep tunnels along the harbor
this is well within reason. The entire length of this project up to North
Washington Street would be cut and cover, significantly reducing costs. At North
Washington Street the tunnel would go beneath government center parking garage
(not sure if a new building is being built there but it's a very short distance
regardless) and then cut and cover won't canal Street to connect it to north
station. (Second picture)  All this would allow every commuter rail line to be a
through line, connecting directly to North, central, and South station with no
deep stations that are difficult to access, it's proximity to the surface also
means that vents would be much cheaper to build so diesels could be run through
the link thus allowing us to create commuter rail without needing to buy hybrid

Could the rail link be constructed as shown above? My thought process is that
the reserve bank building is far enough right there is room to run the tracks
past it (with measures to assure foundational stability) and all that would be
taken out would be a parking lot. Additionally, since there was previously a
track running underneath the main concourse, it is clearly possible for the
platforms to be lower. It would require a rebuild of south station similar to
the one in 1989, which would be very expensive yes, but I think considering the
current plan to tunnel bore several very long, deep tunnels along the harbor
this is well within reason. The entire length of this project up to North
Washington Street would be cut and cover, significantly reducing costs. At North
Washington Street the tunnel would go beneath government center parking garage
(not sure if a new building is being built there but it's a very short distance
regardless) and then cut and cover won't canal Street to connect it to north
station. (Second picture)  All this would allow every commuter rail line to be a
through line, connecting directly to North, central, and South station with no
deep stations that are difficult to access, it's proximity to the surface also
means that vents would be much cheaper to build so diesels could be run through
the link thus allowing us to create commuter rail without needing to buy hybrid

the Ford F150 Lightning and the Nissan Ariya. Afterwards, I decided to return
home to Cambridge via the MBTA. Due to me missing the northbound train to
Alewife (I was just about to enter the gate when the train doors finally closed
and the train left without me), I had to wait another 35 minutes for the next
Alewife train to come. Instead of waiting 35 minutes, I decided to take the
commuter rail to South Station (I only had to wait 10 minutes for that to come)
and ended up going all the way to South Station.  Because I carry my folding
bike with me, it is tedious to carry it up and down the stairs given it takes
longer than just using the elevator (even though I am a relatively strong and
muscular man), so I used the elevator. Knowing that the Alewife train is coming,
I started to approach the elevator when the elevator closed. I basically pressed
the down button and the elevator opened, and when the elevator/lift opened,
there was a white middle-aged woman who was extremely pissed and even though
there are no social distancing policies and she wasn't wearing a mask, she
stated that she did not want to go in the elevator with me and instead, exited
the elevator and instead, used the stairs. Once I got down to the northbound
platform, she (the middle-aged white woman with a pink coat) told me that I am
under arrest even though there are no police officers chasing down me. Before, I
thought she is going to assault me, so I tried to run away from her as fast as I
can whilst carrying the bike with me. But due to the fact there are a lot of
people waiting for the Red Line Train, going as fast as possible isn't very
possible and therefore, I was stuck with her harassing me. I didn't know what to
do and I was so scared that if I recorded the incident on TikTok, something bad
might happen to me (I might get assaulted, which might ruin my day, so I let the
event be)  Now I do have to note that I am an Asian American by the way who was
born in Vietnam in 2001 and moved to Boston in 2012 as an international student
before becoming a US citizen in 2021.  After I left the train, I decided to ask
MBTA staff for advice on whether or not this incident is harassing or not or if
this woman is mad at me for using the elevator along with her even though there
are no social distancing policies being enforced. They told me to report this
incident to the MBTA police. For me, I decided not to report since I wanted to
let the event go due to the fact that I might not see her. What are your
opinions on this incident and is there anyway to report this incident given that
I have no videographic evidence?   There had been incidents where some so-called
'Karens' refused to share elevator with certain people, but I am not certain if
this category fits, because first off, only she was in the elevator and she is
carrying nothing, and plus, the elevator is relatively big, meaning it could fit
her as well as my bike and I with no problems.  The reason why I didn't take
action and record a footage is because I was worried that I might get assaulted
by her and I wasn't sure what to do at the point due to me not wanting to be
assaulted and cause a fight. I am curious if there are any cameras installed at

1mtaeo2,Go Back to 2019 CR Schedules?,"I feel like this should be brought up to whoever writes the schedules out. I
honestly found the CR to be more reliable with the schedules then than now.
There was more rush hour and late night service in both directions, and yes,
there were less trains during the day but there also aren't many people riding
at that hour between (9:45-2:15). Rush hour service was outstanding (30ish
minutes on all lines) and, aside from the Old Colony and Stoughton lines, trains
ran up to 15 minutes past midnight (good for game and event nights). Obviously
this wouldn't apply to the Fall River and New Bedford lines but would be ideal
for the other lines as it would allow the process of adding trains to the
schedules a bit easier. There were the same amount of weekday trains daily on
almost all the lines so it wouldn't make the staff issue that much worse. Also,
lines with single track issues were still timed to not interfere with each other
as they are now. I feel like this would be good for most of the lines. I might
be the only one but does anyone else think so?  P.S. They would keep the weekend
schedules they have now with the last trains leaving a little after midnight (no
later than 12:15am) as the weekend schedules kinda sucked then. Also they would
use them for storm service instead of taking important weekday trains off the
schedules.  P.P.S. The Fairmount, South Coast Rail, and parts of the Providence

1gh62zx,Something needs to be done about Haunted Happenings bus delays,"The past couple weeks, riding the 450 bus has been absolutely brutal. Haunted
Happenings crowds and events mean that the bus get severely delayed on the
northern end of the route, between Salem Hospital and Salem Depot. These delays
then radiate down to everyone else who uses the line in Lynn, Revere and Boston.
It's already a very delay-prone route, but the lateness has gotten completely
out of hand as of the past few weeks. I don't think I took a 450 bus this month
that was less than 15 minutes late. Several were 25 minutes late. It gets so
late that I leave the house for the bus stop factoring in the delay I
anticipate, and then still end up waiting 10+ minutes at the bus stop because of
how badly it crawls, especially on Essex St.   A few days ago I watched on a
tracker as an outbound 450 bus took more than five minutes to make it through
the final ~400 feet of Essex St to the North/Summer intersection. A person in a
cast using crutches could have walked that same distance two or three times and
still beaten the bus. People in Lynn and Revere can't ride that bus inbound
until it finishes running outbound. By the time I got on that bus inbound it was
running more than 25 minutes late. A lot of people in Lynn use the bus for trips
within Lynn and a lot of those people have no other option than to ride the bus.
It happens with the other routes with segments in Salem, 435 and 455 as well of
course. Lots of 15-20+ minute delayed 435 buses the past couple weeks. It's just
my bad experiences have mostly involved route 450 so that's my focus.   I know
it's a tough problem to solve, but they need to be trying something during
October to alleviate this. Whatever they're doing now is NOT working. The
problems this October have been really exasperating, it isn't acceptable. I love
that Haunted Happenings brings a lot of tourism money to the area, but it really
sucks that people in surrounding - poorer - cities are getting raked over the
coals by overtourism that isn't even ours. I don't like being an externality.The
ridership on this route doesn't even seem to go up much during October and it
doesn't seem like tourists use it (and why would they with the train right
there?) so it's not simply a delays due to increased ridership thing like one
might think.   I don't know what would or wouldn't work in the slightest...but
some thoughts I had were: shortening the route to the southern edge of downtown
Salem for October instead of keeping service to Salem Depot; having much longer
layovers after an outbound run so that prior bus can start the inbound trip on
time regardless of how delayed the outbound bus is getting; Temporary bus lanes
in Salem to keep things moving?  also slightly related... I think there should
be another bus schedule timepoint on the 450 bus somewhere between Salem Depot
and West Lynn Garage. It's a really long route with highly unpredictable
traffic. That unpredictable traffic means the schedule is padded for traffic. If
the bus doesn't hit that traffic it starts running early. They shouldn't be
running several minutes early all the way through Lynn and then holding for a
few minutes at West Lynn Garage, but on days where that bus got lucky and hit
little traffic, it sure does that. AFAIK MBTA buses are only required to not
depart a stop early at the stops with times given in the paper schedule. They
should add one of those time points somewhere in between Salem Depot and West
Lynn Garage. I think it would also reflect more accurately on just how
frequently delayed the bus gets through Lynn (AFAIK a bus only counts as 'late'

14yxwm8,We need electrified regional rail.,"Just posted this to Facebook:  We need electrified regional rail in
Massachusetts. This should be a pretty high priority if you are an
environmentalist.   I’m in Philadelphia right now, riding the SEPTA Regional
rail network. This 27 minute train trip will save me ~30 minutes and a ton of
aggravation compared to driving.   Massachusetts operates a Commuter Rail
network in and around Boston. Philadelphia operates a Regional Rail network. The
difference is very important.   A commuter rail network is exclusively meant for
commuters, in and out of the downtown core. You live in the suburbs and work
downtown. Trains are timed to go inbound in the morning, and back to the suburbs
in the afternoon. There is minimal service outside of these times, such as
evenings and midday. This means that the rail network can be useful if you are a
suburbanite, but unlikely to be used any other time.   A regional rail network
is one that is meant to provide decent all-day service, late into the evening.
My specific SEPTA line provides hourly or better service all day, until ~10:30
PM on weekdays. This is in addition to trains every ~20 minutes during peak
hours. I use these trains to visit friends in the suburbs while I am staying
downtown, as well as to commute in last year. This regional rail style service
makes many trips possible that just aren’t with a commuter-only network.  Using
a rail network just for commuters doesn’t make financial sense. Think about it -
the most expensive part of a network is the rails and rolling stock (train cars
and engines). Trains and tracks cost roughly the same amount to maintain,
regardless of whether they are used ten or 100 times a day. If you are letting
all these resources sit idle all day and night, you are wasting money and
encouraging people to drive everywhere!  Diesel trains also kind of suck.
They’re power limited, and therefore slow. They have to carry a diesel generator
on board, making them heavy. They can only produce at most 4,200 horsepower (GE
Genesis P42DC used by Amtrak). They need lots of maintenance, make tons of
noise, smell bad, and pollute pretty badly for a train (not in comparison to
each rider driving, though).   An electric locomotive can produce well over
8,000 horsepower (MARC HHP-8) because it does not need to carry a diesel
generator. They can accelerate much faster (especially electric multiple units
(EMUs)) and hit higher top speeds (125mph or higher). Additionally, they don’t
smell and are almost silent! Plus, operating costs are much lower. There’s far
less maintenance and no diesel fuel needed. They are the cleanest, most green
form of transportation available to humans besides bicycling or walking.   Even
if you’re a driver, you should want more trains! They take other cars off the
road, making YOUR commute by car faster and more efficient, and making parking
easier at your destination. This also means that fewer aggravating road
construction widening projects need to happen! It’s a win-win.   There are
several plans in the MA state legislature for various portions of commuter rail
electrification and conversion to regional rail. Call your reps and tell them
you want this, especially if you’re in central/eastern countries. I would love
to see MA have a fast, clean, fully electric regional rail network in my
lifetime - and the only way that happens is if the people make some NOISE.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"We need electrified regional rail. Just posted this to Facebook:  We need electrified regional rail in

1l76czk,Yet Another Fantasy Map,"Inspired by other users’ maps on this Reddit, and incorporating my own ideas,
this is my current vision for an expanded MBTA. In designing extensions, the
main factors I considered were density and connectivity; what places remain
underserved, and what important corridors are disconnected? Please note that I
am not an engineer, and so may get terminology or track details wrong. I am
simply a regular T rider that loves staring at maps.   **Red Line:**
Northbound, the Red Line extends from Alewife under the Minuteman Corridor
through Arlington, terminating at East Lexington. Arlington is far denser than
Lexington, but I wanted to give Lexington at least one station since it is not
on the Commuter Rail.   Southbound, the Ashmont and Braintree branches now split
at Savin Hill rather than JFK/UMass (name reverted to Columbia,) allowing for
double-tracking on the Old Colony Line. The Braintree Branch is unchanged
besides gaining an infill station at Neponset. Meanwhile, the Ashmont Line
extends to fully take over the Mattapan Trolley, terminating at Mattapan with a
single station in Milton in-between. This removes the need for a transfer versus
the MBTA’s current plan to rehabilitate the Mattapan Line. For more, I’d
recommend reading Sky Rose’s
[article](https://medium.com/@skyqrose/red-line-extension-to-mattapan-b7351aa782e).
**Orange Line:**  Northbound, the Orange Line continues along the Haverhill Line
into Melrose, picking up some dense areas. Southward, the line forks at Forest
Hills, with one branch continuing south to Dedham, and the other to West
Roxbury, taking over the Needham Line. Due to the engineering challenges of
double-tracking through Needham, as well as the town’s suburban nature, I
decided instead to replace the rest of the line with a shuttle service,
extending to the D-Line.   **Blue Line:**  Westward, the Red-Blue Connector is
realized, bringing the Blue Line to Charles/MGH, and then further along the
esplanade to Kenmore. From here, it takes over the Green Line D-Branch out to
Riverside. This brings subway service connecting Downtown to Back Bay, Fenway,
and Longwood, as well as relieving some congestion on the Green Line’s Tremont
Street Tunnel.   Northbound, the Blue Line forks at Maverick. One branch follows
Broadway through Revere and meets the Indigo Line at Linden. The other extends
from Wonderland up through Lynn, Swampscott, and finally Salem. With electrified
regional rail, extending beyond Lynn may be unnecessary, but Salem’s density and
the benefits of redundancy (especially during October) justify the full
extension.  **Green Line:**  The Green Line gets some significant changes. First
of all, Boylston is closed and replaced with a straighter tunnel (less
screeching.) As previously covered, the D Branch no longer exists, instead being
taken over by the Blue Line. The B Branch to Boston College Remains the same.
The C Branch takes over the Northern part of the current D Branch, and extends
from Union Square to Porter.  The North of the E Branch extends one stop to meet
the Commuter Rail at West Medford. Southbound, service continues through Forest
Hills and then connects with the Red Line and a new F Branch at Mattapan. This F
Branch follows Blue Hills Ave and Washington Street before joining the rest of
the Green Line at Park Street. This brings needed service to the South End,
Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan, given the high demand on the 28 Bus and the
need to make up for broken promises on the Washington Street corridor. 
Finally, a new G Branch is added, branching from the new ROW used by the E
Branch. In the East, this runs through South Boston, terminating at Castle
Island. From North Station, it follows the Grand Junction Line through
Cambridge, connecting with the Red Line through a concourse, and then along the
Worcester Line, meeting the Blue Line at Riverside.  **Indigo Line:**  The first
new rapid transit line, this converts the current Fairmount Line to frequent
service, and then follows the new North-South connector through Aquarium, before
forking at North Station. One branch cuts through Cambridge, hitting Inman
Square and Harvard, before following the Fitchburg Line through Watertown and
Waltham. The other branch goes through Charlestown, Chelsea, Everett, Malden,
and Saugus before connecting to the Blue Line at Revere.   **Circle Line:**
Ambitious, yet vital, the Circle/Yellow Line transforms the T by allowing for
connections outside of the Downtown core. Starting at Harvard, the Circle Line
goes through Cambridge and Somerville, replacing the Silver Line through
Everett, Chelsea, East Boston, Logan Airport, Seaport, and South Station. From
there, it continues through South Boston and Dorchester before forking into two
branches: one up Mass Ave on its way back to Harvard; the other through
Longwood, Brookline, and Allston. Were it to be built, it would easily become
the most-ridden line on the system.   **Odds and Ends:**  Less essential to the
overall design, but desirable in a “full-build,” the Mystic Valley Line (not
married to the name) and South Shore Line bring service to areas the system
would not otherwise reach, such as Medford Square, Winthrop, and Hull. 
Additionally, this map assumes an electrified Regional Rail service on the
Commuter Rail, as well as extensions to New Hampshire and elsewhere.   Other
routes I considered were Indigo service through Belmont/Orange to Lynn, a
restored Green Line A Branch, and Orange Line to Norwood, but I decided against
each of these for one reason or another.",43,"stations, trackage, lexington, tracks, map, suburban, junction, east, st, waltham","43: stations, trackage, lexington, tracks, map, suburban, junction, east, st, waltham","Yet Another Fantasy Map Inspired by other users’ maps on this Reddit, and incorporating my own ideas,

I did this work many years back, but the MBTA/DOT had no interest in it, because
it obviates the very purpose of the whole project, which was/is for the benefit
of Boston property developers.  The USPS waterfront property is highly
valuable/costly, so why not trump up a transit need, use the taxpayers to push
them out, and pay air-rights, a fraction of the cost.    I think the project
price tag got to be so high, however, that the air-rights costs went up as well,
but it doesn't change the fact that the whole 'need' was trumped up originally.
Seeing the already absurd price tag for the mere addition of a few new berths,
egads, I put my mind to finding a viable (engineering and operational wise)
solution that doesn't require relocating the USPS facility.    Most just see the
hemmed in situation on each side.  Others go further, looking vertically, but
see that taking tracks up are precluded by several obstacles, and taking them
lower is a no go with the Big Dig fubar, but as well the MBTA still uses fume
emitting engines, which is why over 100 years back the lower level loop was
abandoned.     The epiphany came, when I saw the length of the station and
original platforms.  It was built at at time when trains were the planes of
today, and train stations were the airports.  Trains were long, and so were
platforms.  But, the principal use today is for commuter trips, which is the
purported 'need' put forward by the MBTA.   Train lengths are but a fraction of
what the stations was built to handle.  Ergo, make use of the station's 'length'
to create more berths.   However, it became complicated again, because the DOT
had placed supports for the added bus station overhead 'between' adjacent
tracks/berths, rather than using platform space.  To be fair, I imagine there
was a need to create a solid footing, and that was easier done with the open
ground (even if narrow) between tracks than having to tear up and restore
portions of the platforms.  It was a troubling impediment, for two reasons.
First, to free up space for outer berths, required providing access to inner
berths that bypasses them.  This requires a track shift, but that's where the
bus station supports become problematic.  The narrow (between tracks) supports
meant they needed more of them, a spacing which precludes track shifts between
adjacent tracks.    The only alternative is to shift three track widths over,
also having to split the platforms.  Not only does this double the length of the
shift, troubling enough, it now presents a second problem.  Originally, it was
easy to envision that passengers would use the same platforms for boarding the
outer berths as the inner berths.  But, bisecting the platforms in order to
solve the first problem throws a wrench into that plan.      Epiphany #2.  I had
knowledge.  One, I'd had a lifetime of using Atlanta's airport, where you go
below ground to access outer concourses.  You could use a 'people mover' train,
or you could walk.   As well, at many airports, moving walkways are options when
needing traverse signifcant distances.     Thus, it only made sense to use the
same concept for South Station.  ESPECIALLY given the other knowledge, which is
that the headhouse at South Station has a lower level, today used primarily for
storage.  Indeed, they'd once had a lower level platform (later abandoned).
The two things, made me see that the original problem brought me to a wonderful
new passenger benefit.  Not only would an underground concourse allow access to
outer berths/platforms, it also could be accessed at the outer portions of the
inner berths, allowing passengers using them the convenience of a climate
controlled environment, either going or coming; a major convenience in Boston
winters.    But, that wasn't the only benefit.  The underground concourse would
lead to the head house, where passengers could continue on the lower level if
wanting to access the Red or Silver rail  lines, whose entries are at the same
level; bypassing the more congested main terminal space.  Still, yet another
potential benefit.  The main concourse would run beneath Platform D, and it is
centered beneath the bus terminal.  Escalators could connect it with the main
undergournd concourse, providing bus passenger much easier and more climate
friendly access to reach Dewey Square, or the Red and Silver Lines.   Space
considerations on the platforms were factored in, but expounding on the
particulars is too much for this introduction.   I had begun an implentation
plan, showing the manner (steps) in which the underground concourses, and other
pieces, would have been constructed without undue impact on operations, but what
was the point?  DOT is run by the special interests in Boston.    In fact, I saw
the opportunity (while it was open) for excavating further down to create the
space for a future metro rail line/station running perpendicular to the Red
Line.  That's getting too useful though, for Boston, who'd rather have a useless
intercity rail line put through, ugh.  Metro rail is FAR more
manueverable/flexible in routing than intercity rail, and FAR more useful for
local needs, but I digress.      It's all for naught.  The DOT has, since my
work, begun its wasteful enclosure $$$$, and will waste more of your dollars as
soon as you send them enough (via your clueless politicians).   Make your checks

1bl9prv,I just rode the OL after this week’s diversion. Here is what I noticed + new Commuter Rail map drop.,"Let’s begin with disclaimers.  1.) I only rode to Jackson Square and North
Station only once (meaning a round-trip). This should *NOT* be taken as factual.
We need to wait a couple of days before seeing whether the OL became better (in
terms of speed and time).  2.) I rode two OL trains on my trip back to N.
Station because I stopped at Ruggles to look at the station. This means that
there could be a slower time due to the operator. I also only timed when the
train was in motion.  3.) I do not ride the OL regularly (I am a Red Line/ Bus
66 rider).  Firstly, the train went by smoothly aside from the same few pockets
that has remained under a slow zone. To be more specific, the State,
Ruggles-Roxbury Crossing, and Back Bay- Tufts Med. Center areas all were clocked
in over 2 minutes between each station on an inbound or outbound ride. Reminder
that this shutdown was meant to remove 4 slow zones, so do not expect a big
change in your commute. All other stations were clocked at about 45 seconds to 1
1/2 minutes between each one, which is pretty good for a subway.  Jackson Square
and Roxbury Crossing still has outdated line maps (showing the GL going to
Lechmere instead of the GLX).  Looking at Ruggles, the escalator is still broken
between the platform and the lobby. I did see a new Ruggles renovation and
Commuter Rail map, however, which will be shown.  Overall, I would say the
shutdown was good, but does need to be focused on Roxbury Crossing-State to see
a major change for the OL (and save minutes for riders, alongside Green
St.-Stony Brook and the CC slow zones.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"I just rode the OL after this week’s diversion. Here is what I noticed + new Commuter Rail map drop. Let’s begin with disclaimers.  1.) I only rode to Jackson Square and North

1o9gbpc,MBTA Outline of possible 2026 Service Changes and Modifications,"Here’s what to expect for **2026** in the MBTA’s Bus Network Redesign, based on
current **Phase 2** planning materials. The agency is rolling changes out in
quarterly packages (not one big cutover), with the more complex items scheduled
for 2026. All of this is still **draft** and depends on hiring and bus-priority
projects, but it’s the clearest preview we have right now.   One major 2026
package groups **routes 16/17/18**: Route **16** is slated to be upgraded to a
**Frequent** route (≤15 minutes all day) with its maze of variants simplified;
Route **17** would add early-morning and late-night Sunday trips; Route **18**
would extend from Andrew to JFK/UMass. Trade-offs called out in the draft
include new transfers from a truncated 16 and the loss of Saturday service on
18. The package also flags supporting capital at key transfer points and
targeted transit priority on Columbia Road, Arborway, and Talbot/Dot corridors.
Another headline item is **Route 22**, proposed to extend and be promoted to
**Frequent** with stronger late-night and Sunday service. That change hinges on
new layover/berthing and better transfer access, and it’s explicitly tied to the
ongoing **Longwood Medical Area** (LMA) bus circulation work, with
recommendations expected around **winter 2026** to help finalize routing and
street operations. In short: more all-day frequency, but expect some rerouted
patterns and trade-offs to make the extension work.   A separate package covers
**routes 42/47/91**, with the **47** established as a **Frequent** cross-river
link and coordinated adjustments on the 42 and 91; the draft shows a substantial
**+46%** service increase for that trio. For the **112/113/114** cluster, the
plan simplifies the network by leveraging earlier upgrades—delivering a **+62%**
service increase and adding a new connection to Assembly—while noting trade-offs
like the 112 losing a one-seat Orange Line connection and the 114 no longer
serving a Market Basket stop. These are framed as 2026-and-beyond items, each
advancing on its own timeline as staffing and street treatments line up.   Two
big enablers explain *how* these 2026 packages can actually stick: (1)
**operator headcount** has been climbing, with MBTA reporting 99%+ of scheduled
bus service operated and a path to grow service again; and (2) new
**bus-lane/stop camera enforcement** authority (enacted in 2025) is rolling out,
aimed at protecting bus lanes and reducing delay, alongside shelter, signage
(including E-ink), and accessibility upgrades at hundreds of stops systemwide.
Those operational and capital pieces are the backbone for making the draft
service increases reliable once they go live.   Bottom line: **2026** is
positioned for the “harder” network moves—more routes reaching **Frequent**
status, simplified patterns, and targeted extensions—implemented in waves as
hiring, layovers, and street priority come together. Expect final details and
exact “effective” dates to publish closer to each seasonal schedule change, but
this is the current blueprint the agency is working from.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"MBTA Outline of possible 2026 Service Changes and Modifications Here’s what to expect for **2026** in the MBTA’s Bus Network Redesign, based on

to be living in the future, but the MBTA is out here running trains like we're

subway system in America - congratulations, but maybe it's time to ACT like it's
not still 1897?  I had an RMV appointment at Haymarket the morning this incident
happened. Left WAY before I needed to because I've learned my lesson with this
garbage system. And what happens? The train sits at Copley for 15+ minutes with
zero explanation. Then they finally announce, ""Park Street will be the last
stop, this train is being taken out of service."" Are you fucking kidding me? So
I get off, wait another 10 minutes for the next train, and then THAT train sits
there for another 20 minutes.  I missed my appointment. The one that took me
weeks to schedule. Because the MBTA can't manage to run a single train line
properly.  And here's what really pisses me off - they shut down parts of the
Green Line ALL THE TIME for ""improvements"" and ""engineering work."" So where are
these improvements? What are they actually fixing? Because from where I'm
standing (or sitting on a delayed train), nothing has changed. If anything, it's
gotten WORSE.  How is it so difficult to run a train line? Other cities figured
this out decades ago. Tokyo's trains run on 30-second intervals and are never
late. But Boston can't even get a train to complete its route without taking it
out of service halfway through?  I'm so tired of this. The Green Line is an
absolute joke, and I don't know how much longer I can keep making excuses for
it.  EDIT: I WAS ALREADY LATE FOR THE RMV THING BECAUSE OF THE PARK STREET

1nr3kin,Repurposing the Tobin Lower Level for Transit Crayon Drawings,"TransitMatters made a post with [an idea for using the Tobin Bridge in part for
transit](https://transitmatters.org/blog/where-is-chelsea-mbta-subway-station).
While their post describes potential stations in Chelsea and beyond, it doesn’t
explore where the line could go once it’s in Boston. Here’s some crayon ideas on
where I think it could go using existing services/infrastructure/ROWs to
minimize cost similar to Montreals REM:  1) Blue Line to Chelsea via MGH After
MGH, the line would elevate above ground, cross the Charles on a short bridge,
then connect to the lower level on ramp of the Tobin. This is the highest
capacity and would provide the greatest train frequencies of my proposals. I
assume it follows the current Route 1 alignment. Cons with this are there would
be heavy transfers at downtown stations since it would not make sense for
someone to ride from Chelsea to maverick &amp; beyond and vice versa. The
incline from MGH to Science Park/ West End might also be too much.  2) Green
Line to Chelsea After Science Park/West End, a flat junction and bridge across
the Charles would connect to the lower level on-ramp for the Tobin (I don’t
think there’s space for a grade separated junction like the GLX one. This
proposal would be easier to add a second branch and would allow all 4 green line
branches to go through the entire central subway instead of short turns at gov
center. Stations would be cheaper to construct as well. There is space by Route
1 in West Revere where a highway connection was intended to be built that could
be repurposed for a rail yard. Cons are speed &amp; capacity, the flat junction,
and potential for delays with all the interlining in the central subway. There
is also the issue of trains need to wait at north station until a trolley ahead
clear Science Park/West End.  3) Grand Junction to Chelsea A new light rail line
using the Grand Junction from Allston/West Station to Chelsea. Grade crossings
at Mass Ave and Main St in Cambridge could keep costs down. A cross platform
transfer with the orange line could be made so that inbound riders from Chelsea
can cross the platform to inbound Boston OL trains.   Cons are it would sever
the connection between the north and south sides of the commuter rail system and
it would miss transfers with the red and green lines in Cambridge. The at grade
Cambridge crossings can also be tricky to cross given current traffic (could be
mitigated with gates and signal priority)   The Tobin lower level might be able
to fit a lane of traffic so that there’s two lanes in each direction. If not, it
could be one lane in each direction on the upper deck with the middle lane
alternating direction based on rush hour.  Open to any ideas on these, thought
it’d be fun to share.",43,"stations, trackage, lexington, tracks, map, suburban, junction, east, st, waltham","43: stations, trackage, lexington, tracks, map, suburban, junction, east, st, waltham","Repurposing the Tobin Lower Level for Transit Crayon Drawings TransitMatters made a post with [an idea for using the Tobin Bridge in part for

1nblejq,Getting to school on time with the train,"So I’ve been riding the Red Line to school since December 2023 after my sister
messed up and made me late to school. So with that being said I’m in a similar
predicament now because this year my school updated their attendance policy to
include that you can only be tardy 3 times per term or else you fail the year
instead of the way it was before were you just got detention after being tardy 5
times so with the Red Line being fucked 3/7 days of the week I don’t know what
to do I would take the 210 but it leaves around 7ish which means I would have to
get up incredibly early to get to school and just sit there waiting which I
don’t really wanna do. I’ve also considered just taking an earlier RL train but
then it runs into the same issue where if it’s incredibly delayed again I’m

include that you can only be tardy 3 times per term or else you fail the year
instead of the way it was before were you just got detention after being tardy 5
times so with the Red Line being fucked 3/7 days of the week I don’t know what
to do I would take the 210 but it leaves around 7ish which means I would have to
get up incredibly early to get to school and just sit there waiting which I
don’t really wanna do. I’ve also considered just taking an earlier RL train but

foreseeable future, and this is more of a thought experiment than a serious
prediction. Please also, for the love of god, don’t bring up Old Colony

whether a limited extension of the Stoughton Line to Easton could make sense in

service in mind.   The right-of-way between Stoughton and Easton is mostly
intact and unobstructed, with abandoned track still visible in places and no
significant utility conflicts. From an engineering standpoint, it’s one of the

student commuters and the wider Bristol County market that currently lacks good

floated the idea of realigning portions of the Stoughton ROW to modernize
curves. More importantly, Canton Junction has long been a bottleneck where the
Stoughton branch peels off the Providence Line. In a best-case scenario, the

info on trains delayed in the morning please!*  ***Table of Contents***  *
Preface * General Info on maintenance and issue * Connections and Service
Changes (Updated periodically) * Maintenance/Service Timeline (Updated
periodically, with news stories) * Train trackers * Human Reminder * TLDR  #
Preface: Recent Providence and Franklin line delays  I’ve seen a lot of posts
and comments about the same topic that’s been affecting a majority of us the
past week or so, and wanted to make a thread that could be used to ask
questions, give a little bit of technical info instead of the “something
happened to the tracks, gonna be delayed” to give people a better understanding,
and to generally communicate with others as I believe this will be an issue for
at least the next week-month (good chance even longer) (I know other lines are
experiencing delays with this as well, but ridership wise and delay wise it
seemed appropriate to label it as such)  # General Info  Friday, August 1st, an
Amtrak overhead catenary wire fell, and in addition, a signal box located
in-between Hyde Park &amp; Readville station burst into flames, disabling all
control over the interlocking (the section of track in between a group of
signals, typically with crossovers to enable trains to switch tracks)
Subsequently, Amtrak and Keolis has since put new operating rules into affect in
this area, including the disabling of the signals. You can see the signals
covered up at the moment, with the exception being track 3’s signal board still
operative. Which leads me to believe not all is lost. *(The signal on that track
may not take power or control from this specific box at all though, I just know
it’s the box for this interlocking. Strange to me that they almost certainly
took power down to the box so whether it’s running on temp power or it’s just
always powered, they have no use for the other signals due to the switches being
inoperable anyway)*  However, the addition of the temporary platform at
Readville, with the signals being covered and put out of service officially
until further notice, and the spiking of the switches *(physical spikes put
through the rail ties to secure switches in place, disabling manual control over
the switches as well, which prevents trains crossing over up until Forest
interlocking, located close to Forest Hills)* on tracks 1 &amp; 2 does not
provide a good outlook to the near future to be blunt. There’s been a wide range
of estimates thrown around, between a few days, and two months. I personally
believe it to be closer to the latter, but I hope I’m wrong as I don’t know the
complete extent of the damage.  Expect more temporary schedules to be made
available. With how new this issue is, I expect it to be trial and error of
getting it to run efficiently over the next few days given the circumstances.
They’re currently now running under a lot of pressure, as the rules are changing
day to day on operation in the area, and one missed or misunderstood sentence
can result in being put on temporary leave without pay. This is something nobody
really wants to play around with from an operating standpoint, and the rule set
they’re currently under leads to the slow speeds and long delays we’re currently
experiencing.  All these factors, mixed with delays that already exist from
either Amtrak heading into Boston, or trains late leaving out of Boston, add to
the complexity of trying to keep a consistent schedule through the area with no
consistent train timing. Not to mention workers on and around the right of way
*(its not exactly fun or safe to have a train flying by a few feet away, and
obviously there’s rules against it, particularly needing to operate at certain
speeds around trackside MOW{maintenance of way} equipment)*  **So, overall,
until they work out the kinks with what’s given, add at least 15-30 minutes to
your commute either way right now, and for the coming days. Hopefully(extremely
optimistic) just days, not weeks, and this is resolved quicker than expected,
but more than likely weeks to a month, probably more.** *(Really hoping they
prioritize this, even more than it already is, this kind of thing requires
extensive work, testing, and patience.)*  # Connections &amp; Service changes

Human Reminder  **more below this, not particularly related**  The conductors on
your trains always have the best info, but please keep in mind the amount of
people on each train, and the fact they work multiple trains a day, and probably
have had to answer this question a thousand times in the past few days. It’s
just as stressful and annoying for them as it is for you. It can ***shorten
their breaks***, add stress to an already stressful situation and really ruin
their mood when ***people seem to be mad at them for something out of their
control***, and for a decent amount of them it’s ***the start of their day*** or
***their trip home*** as well, and they’re ***also losing their time.***
They’re just doing their job, don’t argue with them about how you shouldn’t have
to pay, ***pay your fare*** and ***take it up with Keolis*** for the time being.
You not paying risks them getting put out on temporary leave. ***You could ruin
somebodies livelihood***. The conductors aren’t pocketing your money or charging
you like it’s a service they offer. ***It’s their JOB***. They’re just as human
as you, working just like you’re coming from or going to work, ***think about
how early or late they work*** to get ***YOU to work and home SAFELY***. Your
***life and the hundreds of others riding with you*** are the ***responsibility
of the conductors***, and that can be a lot as it is.  The railroad is not a
great industry, and their job can be hard enough as it is dealing with extensive
rule books that are updated daily, ***management watching every move***, the not
so nice side of the general public, along with mechanical issues that they have
to work with or troubleshoot that shouldn’t be an issue in the first place. Not
to mention the fact their shifts can range from ***8-16 HOURS***, usually around
***10-12***, and a lot of them work ***6 DAYS A WEEK***. They aren’t an Uber,
they are ***extensively trained and qualified*** to be in control of the
equipment and handle situations like this, their job isn’t customer service,
it’s to safely assist in the movement of the train *(which some people for some
reason think is a pretty simple day job)* and are essentially federal/state
employees with how much federal oversight(FRA) there is, being essential workers
*(if they shut down the highways for a blizzard, guess who still has to try and
drive on said highway)* and government programs *(railroad retirement etc)*
there are that benefit them as well.  ***They don’t work on the infrastructure,
they work with what they’re given, have some compassion, and realize they’re
doing the best they can (most of them). A thank you, smile, or anything positive
can be the reason they had a good day at work. Imagine the first interaction you
have with somebody at work is a negative or rude one, just because you couldn’t
see something they were showing you or couldn’t hear you. Or just pretend you
don’t exist. The amount of people who don’t even look up when they come around
and treat them as less than human, or servants forced to get them to work is
frankly absurd, as you’d be stuck in traffic for hours without them being there.
Treat them with kindness and it’ll almost always be returned, don’t let a few
bad apples ruin it for both parties, because I guarantee your workplace has the
‘bad’ ones that you think bring a bad look to your place of work too***  # TL;DR
box in charge of choo choo track go boom boom train go slow fix hard take long

Preface: Recent Providence and Franklin line delays  I’ve seen a lot of posts
and comments about the same topic that’s been affecting a majority of us the
past week or so, and wanted to make a thread that could be used to ask
questions, give a little bit of technical info instead of the “something
happened to the tracks, gonna be delayed” to give people a better understanding,
and to generally communicate with others as I believe this will be an issue for
at least the next week-month (good chance even longer) (I know other lines are
experiencing delays with this as well, but ridership wise and delay wise it
seemed appropriate to label it as such)  # General Info  Friday, August 1st, an
Amtrak overhead catenary wire fell, and in addition, a signal box located
in-between Hyde Park &amp; Readville station burst into flames, disabling all
control over the interlocking (the section of track in between a group of
signals, typically with crossovers to enable trains to switch tracks)
Subsequently, Amtrak and Keolis has since put new operating rules into affect in
this area, including the disabling of the signals. You can see the signals
covered up at the moment, with the exception being track 3’s signal board still
operative. Which leads me to believe not all is lost. *(The signal on that track
may not take power or control from this specific box at all though, I just know
it’s the box for this interlocking. Strange to me that they almost certainly
took power down to the box so whether it’s running on temp power or it’s just
always powered, they have no use for the other signals due to the switches being
inoperable anyway)*  However, the addition of the temporary platform at
Readville, with the signals being covered and put out of service officially
until further notice, and the spiking of the switches *(physical spikes put
through the rail ties to secure switches in place, disabling manual control over
the switches as well, which prevents trains crossing over up until Forest
interlocking, located close to Forest Hills)* on tracks 1 &amp; 2 does not
provide a good outlook to the near future to be blunt. There’s been a wide range
of estimates thrown around, between a few days, and two months. I personally
believe it to be closer to the latter, but I hope I’m wrong as I don’t know the
complete extent of the damage.  Expect more temporary schedules to be made
available. With how new this issue is, I expect it to be trial and error of
getting it to run efficiently over the next few days given the circumstances.
They’re currently now running under a lot of pressure, as the rules are changing
day to day on operation in the area, and one missed or misunderstood sentence
can result in being put on temporary leave without pay. This is something nobody
really wants to play around with from an operating standpoint, and the rule set
they’re currently under leads to the slow speeds and long delays we’re currently
experiencing.  All these factors, mixed with delays that already exist from
either Amtrak heading into Boston, or trains late leaving out of Boston, add to
the complexity of trying to keep a consistent schedule through the area with no
consistent train timing. Not to mention workers on and around the right of way
*(its not exactly fun or safe to have a train flying by a few feet away, and
obviously there’s rules against it, particularly needing to operate at certain
speeds around trackside MOW{maintenance of way} equipment)*  **So, overall,
until they work out the kinks with what’s given, add at least 15-30 minutes to
your commute either way right now, and for the coming days. Hopefully(extremely
optimistic) just days, not weeks, and this is resolved quicker than expected,
but more than likely weeks to a month, probably more.** *(Really hoping they
prioritize this, even more than it already is, this kind of thing requires
extensive work, testing, and patience.)*  # Connections &amp; Service changes
u/Massive_Holiday noted some of the alternative connections available for
service to the Hyde Park/Readville area below in the pinned comment. As well as
mentioning to check [***MBTA.com***](http://MBTA.com) for all official
communications, as well as the respective social media channels.  Hyde Park is
offering a ***shuttle bus to replace outbound service to Readville*** to make a
connection at various times of the day, ***marked with a bold brown B on the
temporary schedules.***  Furthermore ***ALL Franklin/Forge Park 495 trains after
9AM will originate AND terminate in FRANKLIN, with a shuttle bus making the
connection between Forge Park and Franklin Stations.***  ***Trains 1770 and 1765
will also have shuttle buses replacing service between Walpole &amp; Foxboro.***
# Maintenance/Service Timeline  ***Will be updating this periodically over the
next month, feel free to forget about this thread or keep it saved to check for
updates. May just be a small “gave us the all clear to go a bit quicker”, to
more accurate estimates. Will also link sources/news stories here***  * *August

the temporary schedule for stations heading inbound BEFORE the work zone other
than the usual few minutes, but to anybody riding outbound waiting for trains
stuck in the work zone, or people who just don’t know, there are multiple free
tools to track your train, with two of them having expected and scheduled
arrival times that I’ll link below.*  *For MBTA GO, you have to click which
train you’re trying to make to see where it is.*  *The MBTA Rail app is not an
official app, but is my favorite for checking speeds, arrival times, and for $1

Human Reminder  **more below this, not particularly related**  The conductors on
your trains always have the best info, but please keep in mind the amount of
people on each train, and the fact they work multiple trains a day, and probably
have had to answer this question a thousand times in the past few days. It’s
just as stressful and annoying for them as it is for you. It can ***shorten
their breaks***, add stress to an already stressful situation and really ruin
their mood when ***people seem to be mad at them for something out of their
control***, and for a decent amount of them it’s ***the start of their day*** or
***their trip home*** as well, and they’re ***also losing their time.***
They’re just doing their job, don’t argue with them about how you shouldn’t have
to pay, ***pay your fare*** and ***take it up with Keolis*** for the time being.
You not paying risks them getting put out on temporary leave. ***You could ruin
somebodies livelihood***. The conductors aren’t pocketing your money or charging
you like it’s a service they offer. ***It’s their JOB***. They’re just as human
as you, working just like you’re coming from or going to work, ***think about
how early or late they work*** to get ***YOU to work and home SAFELY***. Your
***life and the hundreds of others riding with you*** are the ***responsibility
of the conductors***, and that can be a lot as it is.  The railroad is not a
great industry, and their job can be hard enough as it is dealing with extensive
rule books that are updated daily, ***management watching every move***, the not
so nice side of the general public, along with mechanical issues that they have
to work with or troubleshoot that shouldn’t be an issue in the first place. Not
to mention the fact their shifts can range from ***8-16 HOURS***, usually around
***10-12***, and a lot of them work ***6 DAYS A WEEK***. They aren’t an Uber,
they are ***extensively trained and qualified*** to be in control of the
equipment and handle situations like this, their job isn’t customer service,
it’s to safely assist in the movement of the train *(which some people for some
reason think is a pretty simple day job)* and are essentially federal/state
employees with how much federal oversight(FRA) there is, being essential workers
*(if they shut down the highways for a blizzard, guess who still has to try and
drive on said highway)* and government programs *(railroad retirement etc)*
there are that benefit them as well.  ***They don’t work on the infrastructure,
they work with what they’re given, have some compassion, and realize they’re
doing the best they can (most of them). A thank you, smile, or anything positive
can be the reason they had a good day at work. Imagine the first interaction you
have with somebody at work is a negative or rude one, just because you couldn’t
see something they were showing you or couldn’t hear you. Or just pretend you
don’t exist. The amount of people who don’t even look up when they come around
and treat them as less than human, or servants forced to get them to work is
frankly absurd, as you’d be stuck in traffic for hours without them being there.
Treat them with kindness and it’ll almost always be returned, don’t let a few
bad apples ruin it for both parties, because I guarantee your workplace has the
‘bad’ ones that you think bring a bad look to your place of work too***  # TL;DR

1lhw3iu,A little trip to Boston (6/12/25),"Here's some pics from my recent trip to Boston last week!  1. Fitchburg Line at
Waltham  I took the Commuter Rail a total of four times going in and out of the
city from Waltham. The train was late by 5 min and 25 min the two times going
into the city, but they always departed from North Station on time. The trains
were fast, clean, and the seats were very comfortable, just as good as NJ
Transit's trains (coming from a guy from NJ). The ticket app on my phone was
also really easy to use.  2. Red Line at Harvard  I didn't see any of the newer
trains for some reason but these old ones were nice as well. I considered going
all the way down to Ashmont to ride the Mattapan Line but I unfortunately didn't
have the time so I got off at South Station.  3. Green Line (B) at Blandford
Street  I like how many of the Green Line trains mix and match the two cars, so
sometimes the two cars are the same and sometimes they're not.  4. Acela at
South Station  I didn't get to go on the Acela coming to Boston, and I had to
suffer in the dreadful I-95 traffic all the way there. But the day will come...
5. Green Line (D) at Brookline Village  The train was incredibly packed since
this was during rush hour, and the stopping and starting was kind of rough at
times. I tried my best not to fall down, and many others tried as well. Still
the train was pretty fast and I liked how this branch of the Green Line was not
street running.  6. Orange Line at Community College  I love the Orange Line.
The new trains are very cool, and the train goes surprisingly fast at some
parts. It's probably my favorite of all the MBTA lines I went on during my trip.
7. Green Line (E) at Riverway  I didn't get to go on this one, but I had to
unfortunately watch this poor little train get stuck trying to make a left turn
for around 3 minutes. I could do nothing but watch as more and more cars got
backed up behind it. I bet the train dreams of grassy tracks and signal
priority...  8. Bus 61 at Waltham  Going back to my hotel in Waltham, the train
was delayed a little bit at the single-track part, which meant it was going to
be a tight connection to the 61 bus at the station. I had to SPRINT as fast as I
could from the outbound platform to the bus, but I luckily made it. I didn't
have any pictures of the outside of the bus, but I am so thankful that it's
there, since it got me to the hotel for just $1.70 instead of the $20+ I would
have to probably pay for an Uber.  9. All my Charlies!  I absolutely adore the
design of the CharlieCard, it's really unique and I love the story behind it as
well. Also yes, I forgot that you could use your phone to pay at the turnstile,
so I had to buy a CharlieTicket each time. At least they make for some great
souvenirs!  And if you're wondering about the Blue Line... yes, I know it
exists, but a big part of it was closed when I went. But still, the next time I
go to Boston, I'm going to Wonderland...  That's all, folks! Thanks for reading
about my Boston trip, it was so much fun and I love the MBTA! :D",12,"fares, commute, fare, trip, littleton, waltham, cost, shuttle, cheaper, prices","12: fares, commute, fare, trip, littleton, waltham, cost, shuttle, cheaper, prices","A little trip to Boston (6/12/25) Here's some pics from my recent trip to Boston last week!  1.

that they weren’t on break after the first traineven though you have proof).

than usual cause a girl lost her wallet, and then they express two stops but
wait for 5 minutes before doing that for some reason.  Then you try to get on
the green line the next day, they say the train is full so you go to the next
one and they close the door on you even though you can squeeze in that one.

1kin6rv,"The MBTA's ""soft cost"" crisis","The MBTA is in the midst of an underdiscussed long-brewing crisis—not just in
terms of funding shortfalls, state of repair, or service disruptions, but in how
it manages and spends money on capital projects. Specifically, the agency
suffers from a “soft cost” crisis (and by extension, a ""status quo"" issue) that
continues to erode its ability to deliver timely, cost-effective improvements.
Soft costs—expenses not tied to direct construction like design, permitting,
management, and engineering—have ballooned to comprise 30–50% of total project
budgets in many MBTA initiatives. These excessive costs are driven by redundant
planning stages, lack of standardized designs, siloed consultant contracts, and
a fragmented delivery structure. Yet despite this being a known problem for
years, the MBTA has not made any meaningful structural reforms to address
it—even as its funding outlook worsens. This is far from an issue unique to the
T (it's indicative of the bureaucratic contracting industry), but that doesn't
mean nothing should be done.  This dysfunction is especially evident in station
reconstruction projects. Natick Center Station has been under construction since
2020, originally estimated at $36 million over 30 months. Five years later, it’s
still incomplete, plagued by delays from scope changes and supply chain issues.
Lynn Station, one of the busiest commuter rail stops, was shut down in 2022 and
isn’t expected to be rebuilt until 2030. South Attleboro Station has been
indefinitely postponed. And at the Newton stations (Newtonville, West Newton,
and Auburndale), the MBTA is now only committing to 400-foot platforms—too short
for full-length trains—despite budgets comparable to what used to pay for full
reconstructions. The scope shrinkage and delay are symptoms of a deeper issue:
full station reconstructions at the T are now too expensive and too
administratively complex to be pursued at scale under current practices. This
dysfunction extends beyond stations; the South Coast Rail project is another
glaring example of poor delivery coordination, most of which is tied to the
station construction.  [The proposed \\""tiny\\"" Newtonville station will cost
$50 million. By comparison, Natick Center is being reconstructed to full-length
standards for $40
million.](https://preview.redd.it/v6xar38wbsze1.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6fd75912baae47dbd5b996eb86181f85e6e11b)
Meanwhile, a broader backslide in modernization is underway. The MBTA recently
confirmed that Regional Rail modernization will no longer be part of the next
commuter rail operations contract. This reverses prior plans to use a
public-private delivery partnership (PDP) model that would have bundled
operations and capital improvements under one unified agreement. While the MBTA
still intends to pursue Regional Rail as some form of P3, there is no clear
structure or schedule, and this decoupling introduces new risks. Given the T’s
recent fare system modernization fiasco—a troubled P3 with Cubic that has gone
years over schedule and hundreds of millions over budget—the agency must proceed
with caution. If poorly managed, a new Regional Rail P3 could replicate those
failures on a larger scale.  While the MBTA clearly needs new revenue to sustain
and modernize its system, addressing soft costs and reforming project delivery
is one of the few tangible steps it can take immediately, without waiting on
Beacon Hill. For instance, as a model, Phoenix’s Valley Metro light rail system
has consistently delivered extensions on time and under budget. This success is
due to its centralized project delivery authority, design-build procurement
model, and disciplined scope control. Of course, Phoenix’s transit system is
smaller and less complex than Boston’s—but its institutional design and project
culture show that American cities *can* build efficiently with the right
framework.  While soft cost reform is urgent, the question of *how* to implement
it remains. The easy answer would be to bring much of this work
in-house—planning, engineering, and project management—much like New York’s MTA
has done in recent years to reduce its reliance on consultants and regain
control over capital delivery. However, the MBTA currently lacks the
institutional capacity, staffing levels, and pay competitiveness to make this
model feasible in the short term. Building that internal capability would take
years of hiring, training, and structural reform. In the interim, the MBTA must
focus on attainable reforms: adopting design-build delivery, standardizing
project elements like station layouts, reducing customization, and publishing
transparent cost breakdowns. These steps alone could significantly reduce soft
costs while laying the groundwork for a stronger in-house culture over time.
Ultimately, the MBTA does need more funding—that's the easy answer—but it also
needs to prove it can manage that funding responsibly. Soft cost reform is one
of the few levers it can pull in the immediate term without waiting on Beacon
Hill. That means at the very least adopting standardized station templates,
implementing design-build delivery, consolidating oversight, and making cost
breakdowns fully transparent to the public.  Until then, capital improvements
will remain stuck in planning purgatory, and the MBTA will struggle to build the
modern transit system Greater Boston deserves. Damn I should have put all this
on Substack.",2,"fiscal, transportation, funding, budget, massachusetts, financial, deficit, fares, fund, revenue","2: fiscal, transportation, funding, budget, massachusetts, financial, deficit, fares, fund, revenue","The MBTA's ""soft cost"" crisis The MBTA is in the midst of an underdiscussed long-brewing crisis—not just in

speaking, though I stand by every suggestion I made originally, except the need
for a refund — the tickets stay active long enough that I didn't need another to
get home.   So I'd just been waiting 30 mins at Ruggles for the delayed (police
activity) Needham train. Huge Providence (I thought they were also Needham at
first) crowd was waiting for their train too, (probably) drunk after the Sox
game. Three important details:  1. The screen on the side did NOT say Needham
Heights, just had the T logo.  2. No Providence train was announced on the PA
nor shown on the platform screen, so I had no reason to think these people were
trying to go elsewhere.  3. This train, as it often does throughout the day,
said track 1 but pulled up on the track 3 side (same center platform at
Ruggles). I'm used to this the few times I've taken Needham instead of D line it
tends to do this, but I bet it contributed to Providence thinking it was their
train. (Give an announcement about a track change it's not that hard)  So the
Providence crowd rushed to the door and then the flow of people stopped, the
conductor said something to people up front but didn't speak loudly enough over
the chatty Providence crowd so I didn't hear the issue until he finally spoke up
AS THE FUCKING TRAIN WAS ALREADY MOVING, the issue being that these people
weren't going to Needham and the conductor assumed there was no one for Needham
out of earshot waiting his turn to get on the train (I didn't want to be that
guy who shoves to the front just in case but i sure will be from now on, if you
see me and think it's rude you can blame Keolis) and I said ""wait is this
Needham and why are you leaving I didn't know I had to push through I need to
get on"" and he said ""gotta wait for the next one,"" which is a fucking 11pm

shouldn't trust a drunk Providence crowd coming from a Sox game to convey the

their poor communication. Do not strand me for an hour at 10pm. Common sense
dictates that when there's a big crowd stretching back 30 feet from the
entrance, not everyone is gonna hear you unless you yell. Conductor should do
his job and CONDUCT the flow of people. Yes I know they were running late. But
the police activity isn't my fault, I was low key tempted to jump on while it
was slowly moving and cause some more police activity when they'd have escorted
me off (intrusive thoughts did not win, obviously). I wasn't late, I was 10 mins
early. I shouldn't wait another hour for Keolis's idiocy.  Also how can I get a

1j68wha,How much of the Old Colony mainline could be double-tracked for cheap? How much would it cost to do the entire thing?,"With the new South Coast Rail schedules releasing, it's clear that trying to run
four Commuter Rail branches through the largely single-tracked Old Colony
mainline is not good for frequency or operations. Delays on one line could and
likely will impact other lines, and the Kingston/Greenbush lines have taken a
frequency hit with the new schedules. With South Coast Rail unfunded and
seemingly unlikely to happen anytime soon, it seems like double-tracking part or
all of the bottleneck could help mitigate some of these problems (and even if
SCR Phase 2 actually did happen, the pre-existing lines could still use some
relief, especially if a Middleboro/Lakeville Cape Cod extension ever happened in
some future lifetime).  Considering this, I pose a couple questions:  * Is it
feasible for the MBTA to build a single additional siding in a key location that
could fit one full-length train (let's say somewhere between Wollaston and
Quincy Adams) for a relatively low cost? Does such a site exist?  * How much
would it actually cost to do the whole thing, by whatever approach is the
cheapest (whether that be land acquisition, tunneling, dropping the number of
lanes on adjacent streets, or reconfiguring the RL between the Ashmont-Braintree
split and JFK so both branches run on the same tracks until the split and giving
the extra tracks to the CR)? Would you expect this to be a somewhat approachable
cost or would it end up being another huge project?",26,"cape, coast, middleboro, provincetown, berths, south, cost, lakeville, concord, expansion","26: cape, coast, middleboro, provincetown, berths, south, cost, lakeville, concord, expansion","How much of the Old Colony mainline could be double-tracked for cheap?

minutes, partially due to congestion in the central GL subway. Considering that
the service is in theory a very useful link that likely could support more
ridership if people could actually rely on it, is there any chance that the MBTA
could short-turn additional trains to run just along the GLX and increase
frequency? Looking at the track map, it seems like it could be possible to short
turn them just after Science Park/West End (allowing for a transfer to a
throughrunning train from the other GLX branch at Lechmere or Science Park) or
at Government Center (using the Brattle Loop, I believe), or some of both.  Even
just a couple more single-car Green Line trains running in this type of
short-turn pattern at a time could increase frequency and capacity when the GLX

1iatgju,Four hours on Saturday,"My four hours of MBTA Saturday.  Each of these annoyances is trivial.  It’s the
sheer volume of minor annoyances that add up to, “Close Enough For Government
Work”.  ·       With two people waiting on the platform at Waban, a car 3698
marked “Union Station” sails right through without stopping.  ·       Three
minutes later, another single car 3844 stops.  The fare box isn’t working.  This
is not uncommon.  Why don’t they take cars with bad fare boxes out of service? 
How are they going to enforce payment with cars like 3844.  ·       When I get
to GovCen, I see 8-10 people waiting at the non-revenue loop track.  I point
them to the correct track for a train to Copley.  This is the second time this
month I have seen people waiting in this spot.  There should be an eye-level
sign saying that trains do not stop here.  Also, it is not uncommon for patrons
to wait for a train at Park Street, track 3.  ·       Later, at Park Street, I
see a woman wearing a Bruins shirt.  She fails to board a Medford bound train. 
Why? The T helper in the red shirt had told her to take a Union Square train to
North Station.  ·       Keep in mind that there are eleven stops north of Park
Street and the “E” train goes to ten of them.  Today, a train on track 4 at Park
Street arrived with a destination of “E Heath Street”.  This happens all too
frequently leaving many patrons on the platform baffled.

1ook702,My Full Review of MBTA Route 109 — Harvard Square to Linden Square (Malden),"The 109 is one of those under the radar MBTA routes that doesn’t always get
talked about, but it quietly does a lot. Starting right in **Harvard Square**,
it connects one of the busiest Red Line hubs to a chain of neighborhoods and
cities - Somerville, Everett, and eventually **Malden’s Linden Square** \- that
don’t otherwise have many direct cross-town links. I decided to ride it from
Harvard Square, with plans to go all the way to Linden, though I got off around
**Union Square in Somerville** to see how the route handled that stretch. Even
just that segment gave me a solid impression of what the 109 brings to the
table.  # The Ride Experience  Pulling out of Harvard Square Busway is always a
bit of a crawl. the mix of pedestrians, cyclists, and tight turns through the
tunnel can slow any bus to a near stop. But once you’re past the heart of
Harvard and moving along the Somerville line, the ride smooths out. The scenery
changes fast. one minute it’s college row and street performers, the next it’s
neighborhood storefronts, corner markets, and a real “local-bus” vibe.  What
surprised me most was how **connected** this route feels. It’s not just a local
shuttle between squares - it’s a **cross-city connector** that quietly ties
together major urban corridors. If you didn’t want to deal with transferring
underground between the Red Line and Orange Line, this bus essentially bridges
that gap on the surface. You can hop on at Harvard and, without switching modes,
reach Somerville, Everett, and Malden in one Ride.  Even though I exited at
Union Square, I could tell from the schedule and map that the rest of the ride
toward Linden Square gives access to multiple neighborhood centers that have
grown denser in recent years. For commuters, students, and people running
errands, that kind of surface-level connectivity matters more than most realize.
# Comfort &amp; Performance  The bus itself was in good condition. clean
interior, decent temperature, and a smooth ride despite city traffic. The bus
operator handled the route confidently, even through tight turns and light
congestion. Traffic between Inman Square and Union Square can test anyone’s
patience, but the driver kept things calm and steady.  Where things could be
better is **schedule consistency**. The timetable looks neat on paper, but
real-world headways can stretch longer than posted, especially during evening
peaks. You’ll often see a gap of 20 minutes, then two buses arrive close
together. that bunching effect that’s all too familiar across the system.  #
Speed &amp; Reliability  Once you’re out of Harvard’s bottleneck, the 109 moves
fairly well, but the route could benefit from **transit priority improvements**.
Signal priority and short stretches of **dedicated bus lanes**, especially near
Union Square and key intersections in Everett, would easily shave 5–8 minutes
off trips and make it far more predictable.  The MBTA’s recent experiments with
transit-signal upgrades on similar routes (like the 39 and 66) show that these
tweaks work. If the 109 got the same treatment, riders would notice immediately.
# Suggestions &amp; Improvements  If I could change a few things about Route
109, I’d start with three:  1. **Evening Service and Frequency**  \- More
evening trips from Harvard (past 9 p.m.) would make a big difference for shift
workers and riders catching the Red Line home. Right now, service tapers off
just when nightlife and late shifts pick up. 2. **Stop Visibility and Signage**
\- In parts of Somerville, especially around Union Square, some stops are hard
to spot or unmarked due to construction and detours. Clearer signage or
electronic displays would help new riders immensely. 3. **Real-Time Tracking
Accuracy** \- The countdown apps and trackers for this route can be hit-or-miss.
When they’re off by more than 5 minutes, people lose trust and resort to
guessing. Better synchronization with GPS pings would fix that quickly.  # Final
Thoughts  Even though I didn’t ride all the way to Linden Square this time, I
can see the 109’s potential as a **true cross-metro corridor**. It’s a
working-class, practical, community-focused route - not flashy, but essential.
It lets you watch the transition from Cambridge’s academic bustle to
Somerville’s neighborhood life and onward toward Malden’s suburban edge - all in
one continuous line.  With a few operational improvements and clearer rider
information, the 109 could easily stand shoulder-to-shoulder with higher-profile
routes like the 1 or 66. It’s a route that deserves more recognition and
investment, not just as a connector, but as a reliable everyday bridge between
Boston’s inner-core communities.",23,"busway, buses, lanes, traffic, corridor, lane, redevelopment, street, somerville, lynnway","23: busway, buses, lanes, traffic, corridor, lane, redevelopment, street, somerville, lynnway","My Full Review of MBTA Route 109 — Harvard Square to Linden Square (Malden) The 109 is one of those under the radar MBTA routes that doesn’t always get

added ten minutes to my commute. I was trying to transfer from the GL, and since
the center stairs are closed, I had to go to the far end. As I passed the center
stairs (running because I knew from the app that a train was close at hand), I
saw no train in the station, so I was lulled into a false sense of security.
Once I descended the stairs, it took a second for me to notice that the shorter
train was in the station on the far end. I broke into another sprint, but it was
too late. The T employee with the flashlight was signaling the driver to close
the doors, stranding me at Park Street. What’s even more annoying is that the
train before it had left ONE minute earlier, so if it had used common sense and
idled even for two minutes, it would have made for more even distribution

“contactless” system grew from less than 10 percent to more than 25 percent.

set dollar amount on a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket but does not buy a weekly or
monthly pass. The remaining roughly 50 percent of trips involve those time-based
passes or other options, such as T employees.  So in other words, by late

1ny4ttj,Link to petition for getting the T to extend its hours of route 55 back to its original ending of 11pm,"Let’s bring back the 55’s evening freedom. If you live, work, study, or visit
around Fenway, the West Fens, Copley, or Back Bay, you know how the early cutoff
strands people, forces expensive rides, and makes late appointments, games,
concerts, and shifts harder than they need to be. This petition asks the MBTA to
restore the Route 55’s former service span **through 11:00 p.m.**, so riders can
count on a safe, reliable trip home—without checking the clock every minute.
Here’s why restoring the 11 p.m. end time is simple, fair, and overdue: • safer,
better-lit trips after dark, reducing long walks and costly alternatives; • real
access to evening jobs, classes, medical visits, and events, not just daytime
errands; • stronger connections to Green/Orange Line hubs at Copley/Back Bay,
improving transfers all evening; • equity for seniors, people with disabilities,
hospitality and healthcare workers who rely on late trips; • consistency with
the region’s push for better night service, not cutbacks; • a small scheduling
change with a big quality-of-life payoff for thousands of riders.  Add your
name, add your voice, and share this widely with neighbors, coworkers,
classmates, and local businesses. When we speak up together—politely, clearly,
and persistently—the MBTA listens. **Sign the petition today to restore Route 55

This week things have been incredibly strange. The digital boards and the MBTA

morning, but the app and the boards were saying 10 minutes and 20 minutes for
the next two trains. I got on the next train and the train left within a couple
of minutes WELL before the signs said. This happened this morning as well except
I was on the wrong train. Track 2 was supposed to leave before Track 1 and
admittedly I was very tired this morning and got in the train on Track 2 (but
didn’t notice that only a few people were on my train). I was sitting there and
heard the bell go off and looked and saw the other train leave. I looked at the
app and the times immediately changed and went to an absurdly long time before
the train was supposed to leave on track 2. I always leave lots of extra time
before I actually have to be at work so I wasn’t concerned about being late -
more annoyed. But,  once again, the train left much earlier than the app said it
was supposed to. I don’t get it.   This issue has only been going on this week

we know so far about the Fairmount Electrification pilot project which is being
conducted as a P3 with Keolis (not an MBTA project) based on an early June
memorandum.  The project is fully funded, with $11 million of the total $54
million being spent to date. There is still a lot we do not know with this
project, since public transparency regulations do not apply to private
contractors.   Here’s what we know:          •       The MBTA will procure seven
BEMU via a leasing agreement with Keolis.          •       Keolis issued a
Rolling Stock Request for Proposals (RFP) in February 2025, with manufacturer
bids due June 2025 and financing proposals due August 2025.         •       The
MBTA has released a Finance RFP seeking a lessor to purchase the fleet and enter
into a long-term lease agreement with the operator. This lease-structure will be
transferable to future operating contractors.         •       Selection of both
rolling stock and finance partners is expected by Q3 2025, with detailed design
and contract finalization occurring through late 2025 and 2026.         •
Manufacturing will take place in 2027–2028, with field testing and acceptance
occurring throughout 2028. Revenue service will launch upon successful
completion of testing.         •       The system is designed to support
20-minute bi-directional all-day service, enabled by enhanced layover capacity
and battery performance.  Rolling Stock &amp; Infrastructure Design:          •
No mainline overhead catenary will be installed. After dialogue with
manufacturers, Keolis determined that onboard battery capacity will be
sufficient, and no supplemental electrification is required for normal service
or recovery operations. The absence of catenary infrastructure means that
through-service by Amtrak along the Fairmount Line is not planned.         •
Six new electrified layover tracks will be built at Readville, tied into the
larger Widett Circle layover project.         •       A new Light Maintenance
Facility (LMF) will be constructed on an existing MBTA site. The LMF RFP is
anticipated in October 2025 and will provide inspection, cleaning, and routine
servicing capabilities for the BEMU fleet.  $12 Million Track and Right-of-Way
Renewal:          •       A separate, MBTA-funded $12 million capital project
initiated on June 2 will replace all track infrastructure along the Fairmount
Line by Fall 2025.         •       This includes full tie and rail replacement,
ballast rehabilitation, drainage improvements, and signal modernization,
creating conditions necessary for higher-speed, higher-frequency service.
•       The work is intended to eliminate slow orders, improve ride quality, and
prepare the corridor for BEMU testing and operation in 2028.  Rumored or
Speculative Improvements (Not Yet Official):          •       Advocates have

1lcgdc2,TAP Card and The RIDE?,"Hey all! Hope everyone had a prideful commute this weekend!  I’ve got a question
for fellow disabled riders: is it possible to participate in both the TAP card
program and The RIDE? I’ve had a TAP card for a few years now, but as my
disability worsens in the summer and progresses generally, I’m realizing that
I’m avoiding going to important doctor appointments and getting out of the house
because I can’t reliably make the walks between my place and my stop/station or
between the destination stop/station and where I need to be. Even in weather
that doesn’t make me sick, my max walking time is about 10 minutes (and I take
breaks), but in the hotter and/or more humid weather, it’s impossible. I’m
really afraid of missing an appointment, or getting stuck somewhere when I’m
going to be sick or faint alone.  I have paperwork that the Mobility people sent
me, but it’s confusing as to whether or not they accept people who can
conditionally use public transit. One place in the paperwork said they do, but
another place said that you can appeal it, as though it disqualifies you? Like I
said: confusing. I’m afraid of filling it out incorrectly and getting rejected
because I misunderstood something.  Does anyone have any personal insight? I’m
supposed to be regularly going to PT to improve my health, but if I can’t go, or
if I go and show up late and about to pass out, it’s not a good use of my time
or my PT’s. (It would also be nice to see my friends more often…or leave the

From April 1 to April 30, all trains will run from Alewife-Braintree, every 7-8
minutes. Ashmont riders will need to transfer to a shuttle bus from April 1-9,
and a shuttle train from April 10-30.   **Red Line (Starting May 1)**  The
following headways are for the branches (south of JFK). For stations north of
JFK (the trunk), take the numbers and cut them in half.   * Weekday frequencies
will improve from every 12-20 to every 10-16 minutes. * Weekend frequencies will
stay at every 12-16 minutes.  **Note:** The weekday service increases are only
possible because they will be running more 4 car trains, to get higher
frequencies with the limited equipment that they have. The amount of cars in
service will be the same, just spread out over more trains.    **Orange Line:**
* Weekday service improves slightly from every 6-9 to every 6-8 minutes.  *
Saturday Service improves from every 9-10 minutes to every 8-10 minutes (8
during the day, 10 early morning/evenings) * Sunday Service improves from every
12-14 minutes to every 9-11 minutes (every 9-10 during the day, every 10-11
early morning/evenings)     **Blue Line:**  * Some weekday midday trains are
shifted to late nights. (Service will be every 7-8 minutes midday and every
10-12 late night instead of every 6-8 and 10-13, respectively) * Weekend Service
improves from every 9-13 to every 7-10 minutes.    # Bus:  * 70 bus routes + the
Silver line will have service changes. I will only list changes on key bus
routes. For more information on the other routes, go

1io4xup,"NIMBY residents express concern about MBTA proposal to build new rail track in Reading, Massachusetts","https://www.wcvb.com/article/reading-mbta-new-rail-track-feb-12-2025/63776178
Some residents are raising concerns after the MBTA announced plans to install a
new commuter rail track on the Haverhill line in Reading, Massachusetts.  The
proposed plan would allow more frequent diesel commuter rail trains to arrive
and leave Reading every 30 minutes, getting riders to North Station in Boston.
The new plan would send the train further down the track to do a turnaround.
However, where it sits, and how long it will sit and idle is all a part of the
issue with nearby residents.  Residents are worried that the new turnback track
that would be a part of the project could impact conservation land.  ""Increased
trains is going to increase noise and increase pollution,"" Reading resident
Allie Hettler said.  ""There's going to be idling diesel trains for 15, 30, 45
minutes every hour. from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.,"" homeowner Joseph Fleury said.
""That's going to have impacts on the children of Reading, the elderly of
Reading, environmental justice communities."" (EJ in Reading?)   In a statement,
the T wrote the following regarding the plan: ""The MBTA has been making track
improvements along the Haverhill Line to allow for this increased service
frequency. The turnback track in Reading is the final piece of infrastructure
required in order to offer the public more frequent service.""  ""As someone who
commutes from Reading to Boston, I'm all about improving the service. It's
reliably unreliable, right now. It's always late. The people working the T have
to manually put the signals up and down. It's the same infrastructure forever,
the MBTA has been in debt forever,"" Hettler said. ""How are we pouring more money
into a turnback track on the same infrastructure?""  The Reading town manager
says crossing arms coming down and backing up traffic more frequently is not
good for first responders.  Some passengers are onboard and eager for more
frequent trip options.  ""It does hold up traffic you got to be patient and deal

Some residents are raising concerns after the MBTA announced plans to install a
new commuter rail track on the Haverhill line in Reading, Massachusetts.  The
proposed plan would allow more frequent diesel commuter rail trains to arrive
and leave Reading every 30 minutes, getting riders to North Station in Boston.
The new plan would send the train further down the track to do a turnaround.
However, where it sits, and how long it will sit and idle is all a part of the
issue with nearby residents.  Residents are worried that the new turnback track
that would be a part of the project could impact conservation land.  ""Increased
trains is going to increase noise and increase pollution,"" Reading resident
Allie Hettler said.  ""There's going to be idling diesel trains for 15, 30, 45
minutes every hour. from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.,"" homeowner Joseph Fleury said.
""That's going to have impacts on the children of Reading, the elderly of
Reading, environmental justice communities."" (EJ in Reading?)   In a statement,
the T wrote the following regarding the plan: ""The MBTA has been making track
improvements along the Haverhill Line to allow for this increased service
frequency. The turnback track in Reading is the final piece of infrastructure
required in order to offer the public more frequent service.""  ""As someone who
commutes from Reading to Boston, I'm all about improving the service. It's
reliably unreliable, right now. It's always late. The people working the T have
to manually put the signals up and down. It's the same infrastructure forever,
the MBTA has been in debt forever,"" Hettler said. ""How are we pouring more money
into a turnback track on the same infrastructure?""  The Reading town manager
says crossing arms coming down and backing up traffic more frequently is not
good for first responders.  Some passengers are onboard and eager for more
frequent trip options.  ""It does hold up traffic you got to be patient and deal
with it,"" passenger Chris Storti said.  ""The improved service will be great for
the community but we want to understand the other costs we are going to
sacrifice,"" Fleury said.  Reading neighbors are having a gathering to share the

1hwl747,Is there a bike department at the MBTA?,"Wondering if anyone knows if there is a bike or active transit arm of the MBTA
and who the person in charge of it would be?   I was thinking about some of the
policies that I have encountered lately while taking my bike on the commuter
rail or the Red Line and I'm wondering if it were worth updating those policies
for more nuance.   For example: As a reverse commuter, the trains are often
empty outbound, and it seems counter productive to give MBTA staff a pointless
mandate to chase people with bikes off of them. I completely understand why
bringing a bike on during rush hour when space is limited is not ok, but the
current policy is also not great at stopping this.   For example: If I were to
board at Alewife at 0650 would I be compliant with the policy even though I'd
likely end up at Park or DTX closer to peak travel around 0715 - 0720? If not
compliant, (as I suspect most would agree) there is no real enforcement
mechanism once someone has boarded.   For my part I usually head to South
Station and grab the commuter rail outbound, but if I miss it I head to JFK and
go outbound from there during rush hour. I am asking this group because today an
ambassador yelled at me for going outbound from South Station at 0705 on the Red
Line and realistically the train and platform were empty.  Ultimately I'm
wondering if the MBTA has some sort of Micro-mobility / active transportation
wing to see if there are ways to better improve the synergy there. Additionally,
the draw one bridge project dumped the promised bike/pedestrian link from the
design. It just seems like the MBTA is missing a huge part of the ridership that

The round-trip cost is $5.50 with reduced fare. If I wanted to drive in closer
to say Littleton, Acton, Concord, etc they charge a daily $5 dollar parking fee.
The other caveat is that I must be to work by 9 am. This eliminates every train
but two. To be on time, I would have to take the 7:03 am from Littleton (this
train starts in Littleton with no pickups from Ayer or Shirley) which would
incur an additional $6 dollar charge. If I wanted to take the next available

Ring route, also with Newburyport\/Rockport line re-routed. W = West Station, E
= Encore Arena, T = Tobin
Re-build.](https://preview.redd.it/pobg6utfejud1.png?width=983&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab51dccc3f8be20a22cb6026d5aa5787ed72d8a)
# Introduction  I realize this is completely re-inventing the wheel for Urban
Ring, but with all the Grand Junction discussion lately, I want to share my own
prohibitively expensive idea for how to iteratively implement improved rapid
transit. It also incorporates a few current events that aren’t reflected in the
original plan.  Really, it’s just a massive extension of the Silver Line. As
someone who rides SL3 frequently, I have seen the glory and goodness of **true**
BRT in those short sections. Additionally, my limited transit knowledge leads to
me to believe that BRT could eventually be converted to LRT, so I’m working with
that assumption. As such, my goal is to install piecemeal dedicated ROW in a
manner that would be efficient for riders and digestible for the attached
financing.  # Phase 0  Let’s outline the dedicated ROW we’ve already got:  *
Silver Line Way * Chelsea Busway  And some related items that should supposedly
be done in the near future:  * Sullivan Extension * Airport Covered Walkway  #
Phase 1  Next, add some features to improve the existing ridership experience:
* Boylston Tunnel * D Street Underpass * 90 On/Off-ramps  The Boylston Tunnel
will coalesce the SL1/SL2/SL3 with the SL4/SL5 routes and create create
connections with the Green and Orange lines before resuming its route on
Washington Street. The Seaport improvements will remove the ridiculous off-peak
detour and cut several minutes off legs through the Ted Williams.  With the
motivation for these improvements being a private investment:  * Encore Arena,
new home of the Celtics  Access-wise, I really believe it makes no sense for the
Celtics to leave North Station, but for the purposes of incentivizing ridership
for in my fantasy world, we’ll feed into this rumor. Hell, for the cartoonish
sake of this post, let’s assume Bezos buys the Celtics and pays for everything
in Phase 1 himself. The Silver Line now has a relatively direct route (I-90
traffic aside) from Nubian to Sullivan, and a good collection of attractions
between the Common, Seaport, Encore, and the Airport.  # Phase 2  With newfound
public interest, and this infrastructure falling apart every time I drive on it,
I’m doubling down on the curveball:  * Tobin Bridge Re-build *
Newburyport/Rockport Re-route * Mystic River Busway  With support for rail when
the Tobin is replaced, the Newburyport/Rockport commuter line will run over the
bridge for a more direct link to Chelsea. This will relieve the industrial
trackage and MBTA Mystic River Bridge (Note: I have no idea if these are used
for freight) to replace with a busway. This provides unimpeded access from
Eastie all the way to the Encore Arena, the Gateway Center, Assembly and
Sullivan.  # &lt;North/South Rail Link&gt;  There is an intermission for NSRL as
this needs to happen to relieve the Grand Junction line.  # Phase 3  With NRSL
complete, the Grand Junction railroad will be replaced with yet another LRT
forwards-compatible busway:  * Grand Junction Busway * West Station  This
extends the ring all the way through dense areas in Cambridge to
Allston/Brighton with a connector for the Worcester line. This would require
some linkage to Sullivan in the rail spaghetti by the Boston Engine Terminal.  #
Phase 4  Over time, eliminate the remaining grade crossings throughout the ring.
With this route, my guess of ordering by trip time saved:  * Ted Williams Busway
* Mass Ave + Main St Bypass * Washington Tunnel * Eastie Busway/Bridge  And in
the ultra-long run, items that speak for themselves:  * Complete Ring * Rail
Conversion  # Conclusion  Thanks for reading. As stated, this is basically just
Urban Ring with a Celtics move and a Tobin re-build/re-route, and it’s too
expensive to ever happen, but I like to daydream of a time when all this ROW
will be linked together cohesively for the people.",23,"busway, buses, lanes, traffic, corridor, lane, redevelopment, street, somerville, lynnway","23: busway, buses, lanes, traffic, corridor, lane, redevelopment, street, somerville, lynnway","Fantasy Proposal for the Urban Ring (w/ Current Events) [Screenshot from Snazzy Maps transit drawn in.

1fk5skw,"TransitMatters declares that the MBTA has improved under leadership of Eng, but some advocates are worried about the impending 700 million dollar deficit that could end the MBTA altogether. Here is what you need to know. (via WBUR)","**THE DATA TO PROVE THE MBTA IS IMPROVING**  Trip frequency on the core subway
system has climbed, and in some cases has completely reversed the FTA-era cuts.
Under the fall 2024 schedule that took effect last month, the T now plans to run
198 Blue Line round trips and 165 Orange Line round trips on a typical weekday —
the highest level since 2016, according to TransitMatters data.  Through Aug.
13, before the latest Red Line work began, MBTA officials said they had lifted
more than three-quarters of the speed restrictions that once plagued the system
and shaved a collective 45 minutes off subway travel time as a result.  With
tracks now able to support higher-speed travel, trains are moving faster, albeit
not quite at the same levels they once hit. Over the past 18 months, average
train speeds have increased 33 percent on the Red Line, nearly 25 percent on the
Blue Line and 12.5 percent on the Orange Line, according to a News Service
analysis of TransitMatters data.  **WHAT’s NEXT?”  Eng said he thinks the
biggest hurdle on the horizon for the T is the enormous backlog of work needed
to bring the entire system into a state of good repair. Last year, the agency
put a $24.5 billion price tag on fixing every asset that's currently not in a
state of good repair.  In addition to the track program, Eng said there's a
number of things on his to-repair list: upgrading the subway's signals, getting
new Orange and Red Line cars on the tracks, eventually replacing Green Line
trolleys with new Type 10 cars, modernizing stations, and improving accessible
service.  For everyday riders, [TransitMatters Lab Co-lead] Matté said he hopes
the T will focus next on shortening headways.  ""You want to be able to just show
up at the stop and know that it's not going to be that long until your next
train if you miss one. You don't have to plan around a schedule, you're not late
because of the T. You just know you have to get up, get to the T, and know how
long it'll take you to get to your destination,"" Matté said. ""For everyday
riders, it's about dependability.""  Unlike the public campaign to eradicate slow
zones by the end of 2024, Eng didn't identify any one specific area among the
$24.5 billion state of good repair backlog as his primary goal for the upcoming
year.  ""All of these go hand in hand, and then where are the bigger things that
we need to look at? And there's a lot of desire to see: where do we envision
taking the T in the future?"" Eng said, identifying ""workforce, safety and
accessibility"" as key components of what he sees as the T's roadmap.  As for
future improvements, Johnson said one of the impediments to excellent service
has to do with aging trains on the Red Line, which too frequently break down.
The MBTA has ordered more than 250 new cars and Johnson said the entire order
can’t get here fast enough.  He’d also like to see the T address deficiencies in
bus service.  “Bus trips or slow travel times on the bus are really persistent
issues,” Johnson said. “And those obviously aren’t going to get fixed by
(elimination of) the slow zones or any work on the train.”  He said the focus
next year should be on improving bus operations.  “How do they make sure you’re
not having dropped trips – or what we call ‘bus bunching,’ Johnson said. “That’s
when there’s no bus for a long period of time, then two show up and they’re
overcrowded.”  **THE MBTA’s FUNDING CRISIS AND POTENTIAL END OF PUBLIC TRANSIT
IN BOSTON**  In fiscal year 2026 — which begins in July — T budget-writers
expect to face a roughly $700 million budget shortfall, and they forecast the
gap will grow in subsequent years. Without additional assistance or major cuts,
the MBTA could run out of cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the latest
agency-produced forecast suggests.  Kane [leader of the MBTA Executive Board]
said a solution will need to emerge quickly, especially because the T would need
to notify workers in the spring about hypothetical layoffs — putting at risk
much of the improvement accomplished.  ""In 2021, the T put a series of draconian
service cuts on the table,"" he said. ""They expected to net $142 million from
that. This deficit is five times greater than that deficit. There isn't five
times more service to be cut and still call themselves a public transportation
agency. It's an existential crisis.""  Warnings about the T's financial outlook
are a perennial feature on Beacon Hill, and some skeptics might view them like a
modern-day boy who cried wolf.  Kane insists that the situation is worse now
because of lingering effects from the pandemic. Ridership — and the fare revenue
it brings with it — still remains stuck well below pre-COVID levels, and
commuters who have come back appear more likely to pay for individual trips
rather than the weekly or monthly passes that steer more money to the T.  Eng
said MBTA officials are talking about potential cost savings, and he suggested
he is not ""panicking"" about the potential shortfall. He stressed that ""we're not
going to be able to find all of those savings on our own,"" seemingly hinting
that the T might look for an infusion of state aid.  T officials in recent
months have cast heightened attention on the agency's funding history,
delivering lengthy public presentations about the ""forward funding"" system that
dedicates a portion of the state's sales tax revenue to the agency.  ""We saw the
disinvestment in our infrastructure, we saw the disinvestment in our workforce,
and that absolutely was the wrong direction. That's why we want to make sure
that we continue to talk about how we got to where we were just a year and a
half ago, and where we've come from from that point,"" Eng said.  He continued,
""That is just to show, starkly, that we don't want to go back there. Nobody
wants us to go back there.""  **WHAT DOES TRANSITMATTERS THINK ABOUT THE
FINANCIAL CLIFF?**  (VIA BOSTON 25)   The T’s current funding plan is flawed,
[TransitMatters Executive Director] Johnson said. “A significant portion of the
T’s funding comes from sales taxes. The sales tax (revenue) was expected to grow
5 to 7% year over year and that growth has been closer to 1 or 2 or 3 percent.”
Johnson said that, over the last 15 years, the T has missed out on between $10
and 15 billion.  “What was misunderstood at that time was the impact online
sales were going to have,” he said.  At first, like many states, Massachusetts
did not collect sales tax on online purchases – but eventually did.  Johnson
said the other issue is that the service sector in the Boston area has seen high
growth – and that sector is not a source of sales tax revenue. He hopes the
legislature will come up with a new and stable funding source going forward.",20,"shuttle, trainsets, schedule, weekday, june, lines, branch, april, speed, spring","20: shuttle, trainsets, schedule, weekday, june, lines, branch, april, speed, spring","TransitMatters declares that the MBTA has improved under leadership of Eng, but some advocates are worried about the impending 700 million dollar deficit that could end the MBTA altogether.

1fd12vi,MBTA News | MBTA and GM Eng to consider adding late-night subway service (via GBH),"Bar-hoppers, concert-goers and late-night workers who struggle to commute to and
from jobs — MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng says he wants to help you.  While
other major cities like New York and Chicago offer 24/7 subway service, the T’s
trains usually don’t operate from about 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. But during an
appearance on Boston Public Radio Monday, Eng said he’s considering running some
trains later to help people who need more transit options after midnight.  “I’ve
been talking with my operations folks regarding the potential for later night
service,” Eng said.  His comments came in response to a caller who complained
about being stranded after a concert at Gillette Stadium this summer. The caller
said she was able to take a special service commuter line train from Foxborough
that arrived at Back Bay at around 1 a.m. But she missed her connecting Orange
Line train to Malden — which was the final one of the night — so she had to pay
$38 for an Uber.  Boston’s subway system used to offer 24-hour service until the
MBTA took it over in the 1960s. Most recently in 2014, the T ran a late-night
train, but the pilot ended after two years because the agency said ridership
wasn’t high enough to justify the operational expenses.  Eng acknowledged the
cost concerns Monday, but suggested more late-night options may still be
worthwhile.  “How do we make sure that people that want to use our system for
these events can use it in both directions and get to home and to the event
safely and reliably,” he said. “For our essential workers, too. I know so many
people that need our system start [work] earlier than our system starts, or
[work] later.”  The possibility of late-night service comes as Eng remains
confident that overall ridership on the subway will increase.  Rider numbers
across all T services have been hovering at around 65% of pre-pandemic levels.
That’s even though the commuter rail has seen ridership rebound better than
similar train lines nationwide, Eng said.  Going forward, he said the subway
will become a more attractive transit option as the T improves reliability. He
said the agency is on pace to eliminate all slow zones by the end of the year.
New Orange Line and Red Line cars also are being delivered after years of
delays, and the T plans on upgrading Green Line trains as well.  “Safe,
reliable, frequent service brings people back,” Eng said. “We’re already seeing
that the frequency of our subway lines are increasing. On all of our Red,
Orange, Blue, Green [lines], we’re running more trains.”",37,"night, overnight, evening, 10pm, midnight, weekend, uber, late, service, around","37: night, overnight, evening, 10pm, midnight, weekend, uber, late, service, around","MBTA News | MBTA and GM Eng to consider adding late-night subway service (via GBH) Bar-hoppers, concert-goers and late-night workers who struggle to commute to and
from jobs — MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng says he wants to help you.  While
other major cities like New York and Chicago offer 24/7 subway service, the T’s
trains usually don’t operate from about 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. But during an
appearance on Boston Public Radio Monday, Eng said he’s considering running some
trains later to help people who need more transit options after midnight.  “I’ve
been talking with my operations folks regarding the potential for later night
service,” Eng said.  His comments came in response to a caller who complained
about being stranded after a concert at Gillette Stadium this summer. The caller
said she was able to take a special service commuter line train from Foxborough
that arrived at Back Bay at around 1 a.m. But she missed her connecting Orange
Line train to Malden — which was the final one of the night — so she had to pay
$38 for an Uber.  Boston’s subway system used to offer 24-hour service until the
MBTA took it over in the 1960s. Most recently in 2014, the T ran a late-night
train, but the pilot ended after two years because the agency said ridership
wasn’t high enough to justify the operational expenses.  Eng acknowledged the
cost concerns Monday, but suggested more late-night options may still be
worthwhile.  “How do we make sure that people that want to use our system for
these events can use it in both directions and get to home and to the event
safely and reliably,” he said. “For our essential workers, too. I know so many
people that need our system start [work] earlier than our system starts, or
[work] later.”  The possibility of late-night service comes as Eng remains
confident that overall ridership on the subway will increase.  Rider numbers
across all T services have been hovering at around 65% of pre-pandemic levels.
That’s even though the commuter rail has seen ridership rebound better than
similar train lines nationwide, Eng said.  Going forward, he said the subway
will become a more attractive transit option as the T improves reliability. He
said the agency is on pace to eliminate all slow zones by the end of the year.
New Orange Line and Red Line cars also are being delivered after years of
delays, and the T plans on upgrading Green Line trains as well.  “Safe,
reliable, frequent service brings people back,” Eng said. “We’re already seeing
that the frequency of our subway lines are increasing. On all of our Red,
Orange, Blue, Green [lines], we’re running more trains.”",0.010052998550236225,0.7635857462882996,0.2263612598180771,0.21630826592445374

Line will be slow-zone free by October, the Red Line by December, and the Green
Line by November. In October, the Orange Line shutdown will be split in two,
with early October being scheduled for a shutdown between Back Bay and Forest
Hills and late October being scheduled between North Station and Oak Grove.  *
In November, the Green Line will be shutdown between Park Street, Medford/Tufts,
and Union Square to fix slowzones between Government Center and North Station.
* In December, the Red Line will have two shutdowns, first working on the
Kendall/MIT-Central southbound slowzone (with a Harvard-Park shutdown), then
finishing up with removal of slowzones near JFK/UMass.  **RIVERSIDE
REDEVELOPMENT**  * The MBTA is planning to redevelop the Riverside parking lot
with 540 housing units (with 20-25% of them being affordable housing), over 650

The MBTA is now talking about how the state’s forward funding method to support
the MBTA has failed to keep up with inflation and how it needs more support to
avoid a potential catastrophic closure of the MBTA system.   * GM Eng has been
talking to the US government to ask for operating funding from groups such as

decades, showing that more people are starting to think the MBTA is improving
among the Commuter Rail and buses, but not the trolley or subway, have different
views of how to finance the system, and more. These statistics are shown above

improve the rolling stock of the Commuter Rail.  3.) Another person in the
public talks about the financial cliff the MBTA is currently facing for next
year budget.  4.) GM Eng then talks about the past shutdown on the Orange Line
and the upcoming one starting on Saturday as a part of the Track Improvement
Program.  5.) There will be no more Red Line shutdowns as a result of the
Dorchester Avenue bridge that leads in and out of the Andrew-JFK/UMass and will
reopen in September.   6. ) Eng then talks about the South Coast Rail  and what
is causing the delay of service (they are running test trains until January and
then needs final verification to run trains by the federal government to make
sure the infrastructure works). They will see how to accelerate work to open
service earlier.  7.) Eng next talks about the work force (about 7,600 workers
in the MBTA system as of right now) and labor unions (all labor unions are now
in agreement with the MBTA).

1dcpyvt,Ridiculous MBTA Customer Service,"I can see that MBTA doesn't train their staff properly and makes it difficult
for clients who paid for the service to ride their transit.  I paid for a
monthly $90 Perq Charlie card last month (May 10th), and it should have arrived
before June 1st to use for this month. But it got sent out late, and I've been
waiting for it since without any success. When I called my employer benefits dep
and MBTA last week to let them know that my card didn't arrive, they immediately
sent out a replacement card and later announced by email that a replacement card
fee of $5 will be charged. I didn't ask for a replacement card and definitely
not for a fee. They are charging me $95, but I haven't gotten anything. This is
the definition of poor service.  Today, when I was trying to ride the train, the
staff stopped me and asked me to step down because I only have the receipt and
not the card. Even after explaining my situation, she said since the card is not
physically here, I still need to pay for each ride. This is so RIDICULOUS that
I'll repeat: MBTA staff is saying that I cannot ride the bus or subway without a
card or ticket, so I need to step out of the subway train and pay for a new
Charlie card or walk up to Park Plaza Charlie Card store to get another Charlie
card. She didn't get the difference between regular Charlie card and a Perq
employer benefit Charlie card. I cannot get a random Charlie card at the store
because the Perq Charlie card is handled by another department... She was so not
getting it and SO UNHELPFUL and SO RUDE!  This should be addressed properly so
that MBTA staff doesn't ask clients who rightfully paid for the monthly rides to
pay extra out-of-pocket for what MBTA and mail service did wrong. Is MBTA trying
to punish clients for purchasing their service? If so, we should sue them.",1,"card, charliecard, payment, cards, bank, debit, transaction, pay, ticket, credit","1: card, charliecard, payment, cards, bank, debit, transaction, pay, ticket, credit","Ridiculous MBTA Customer Service I can see that MBTA doesn't train their staff properly and makes it difficult

fee of $5 will be charged. I didn't ask for a replacement card and definitely
not for a fee. They are charging me $95, but I haven't gotten anything. This is
the definition of poor service.  Today, when I was trying to ride the train, the
staff stopped me and asked me to step down because I only have the receipt and
not the card. Even after explaining my situation, she said since the card is not
physically here, I still need to pay for each ride. This is so RIDICULOUS that
I'll repeat: MBTA staff is saying that I cannot ride the bus or subway without a
card or ticket, so I need to step out of the subway train and pay for a new
Charlie card or walk up to Park Plaza Charlie Card store to get another Charlie
card. She didn't get the difference between regular Charlie card and a Perq
employer benefit Charlie card. I cannot get a random Charlie card at the store
because the Perq Charlie card is handled by another department... She was so not
getting it and SO UNHELPFUL and SO RUDE!  This should be addressed properly so
that MBTA staff doesn't ask clients who rightfully paid for the monthly rides to
pay extra out-of-pocket for what MBTA and mail service did wrong. Is MBTA trying
to punish clients for purchasing their service? If so, we should sue them.",0.8776374459266663,0.11442168056964874,0.007940885610878468,-0.8696965575218201

1cwomze,MBTA NEWS: MBTA and Town of Arlington to Extend Shared Bus/Bike Lane on Mass. Avenue through MassDOT’s Shared Streets and Spaces Grants. Here’s what to know.,"This extension will help support Bus Route 77 (Arlington Htgs-Harvard) by
installing the extension of the shared bus/bike lane. This begins today, May
20th, with completion anticipated in the next few days (weather depending). The
project includes the addition of an outbound lane from Alewife Brook Parkway to
the opposite side of Lafayette Street.  **CITED FROM MBTA**  The expanded shared
bus/bike lane will benefit approximately 5,000 daily bus riders using Route 77,
based on Fall 2023 ridership. This segment of Massachusetts Avenue will also
provide a link to existing inbound bus lanes in Arlington and Cambridge on
either side of the new segment, which will span from Boulevard Road to Alewife
Brook Parkway, facilitating smoother bus travel and enhancing the convenience of
traveling from Arlington to Harvard Square. A study by the City of Cambridge
found that buses traveling on Massachusetts Avenue were 31-40% faster on average
after the installation of this bus lane in late 2021 between Dudley Street and
Alewife Brook Parkway.    In conjunction with the expansion of the shared
bus/bike lanes, the installation of a Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon (RRFB)
at the Lafayette Street crosswalk is expected to yield safety enhancements,
improving overall mobility and circulation for residents, employees, and

1bm8rl7,"RLX Branch Suggestion from Harvard to Brandeis/Roberts... via Mt. Auburn, Arsenal, Watertown Square, and... Russo's (RIP!).","I've been a low-key transit nerd most of my life; I remember being a kid and
asking for my own street map atlases (remember those old Arrow brand ones) after
seeing my Dad's, and getting them, and drawing railroad extensions all over
their pages. Been seeing a lot of futureMBTA maps lately and what-could-bes and
what-could-have-beens, been following the space since the days of
vanshookenraggen at least. Have a lot of thoughts on the matter; Thought I'd
toss my hat in the ring for some extension ideas. Here's a first for an RLX
branch off Harvard... maybe there'll be more.  **RED LINE**  This is the line
I've thought about the most. Southwards it's pretty set; One could argue the
Mattapan Trolley should be converted to heavy rail and fully integrated into the
rest of the line, but I'm mainly focused on completely new lines here. I've long
thought a branch coming off Harvard would bring lots of benefit, and I've put a
lot of thought over some years into what it could look like. Here's what I think
would be the best for it to look like.  --  *Harvard Extension Branch*  *
Riverbend Station: Northwards (well, westwards, really), starting from Harvard,
this line would run under Mt Auburn Street with a stop at Riverbend, just past
Longfellow Park. This could both serve the Mt. Auburn Hospital as well as
Longfellow Park and by extension the LDS Church, as well as the Riverview
Condominiums and other dense housing in the area. As you'll read below, the LDS
Church, with all its focus on genealogy and respect of our ancestors and
deceased relatives, would probably also benefit from a direct connection to
*four* cemeteries (at least! -- four by my count, anyways) -- Mt. Auburn
Cemetery and Cambridge Cemetery (which of course it already has via the 71 &amp;
73), but then Calvary and Mt. Feake as well.  --  * Mugar Square Station:
Continuing onwards to the intersection with the Watertown-Cambridge Greenway (on
the old Watertown Loop RoW), there'd be a second station around there. Off
admittedly only a little preliminary research, the Mugar family are prominent
philanthropists in the Boston area who've seemingly supported lots of quality
causes over the decades, and their fortune originates in Star Market. Not only
that, but some of its members are buried in Mt. Auburn Cemetery, and they were
longtime residents of Belmont and Watertown. It's just an idea, but it could
make a lot of sense, maybe, to name this intersection/area in their honor --
It's where the Mt. Auburn Cemetery is, as well as a Star Market. An alternate
name here would obviously be ""Mt. Auburn,"" though my hesitation to just go for
that out the gate is the confusion it could create with Riverbend Station, which
would be the ideal stop for the Mt. Auburn Hospital. In any case, the Mugar
Square station would service the Mt. Auburn Cemetery of course, as well as
encourage further development of the space the old Star Market currently
occupies. I have nothing against a supermarket there, but it's flat and wide
with an enormous parking lot; Much could be done with that space in this day and
age, and possibly even the space between the Star Market all the way to Aberdeen
Ave. There's a big mix of old and new there that could all be redeveloped into
much more efficient use of the acreage, perhaps even built around the new
station or with it in mind. And hell, maybe naming it after the Mugars secures
some funding; Lord knows the T needs it.  --  * Arsenal Station: From Mugar
Square, the line would run under the Watertown-Cambridge Greenway to the Arsenal
and Watertown Malls. With the Arsenal recently redeveloped and becoming far more
of a community center, I'd redevelop the Watertown Mall (which is also already
being discussed anyways) next, to again more efficiently make use of that space,
building the station around it. Naturally, this station would service the malls
and the Arsenal as a whole.  --  * Watertown Square Station: From Arsenal I'd
cut-and-cover under Arsenal Street to Watertown Square. Again, like the Arsenal,
this is pretty self-explanatory. It would also offer an alternate route to the
71 to get from Harvard to Watertown Square or vice versa, lightening the load on
one of the T's higher-traffic bus routes (not that the 71 compares to the 1 or
anything, but... it's up there), possibly without fully making it obsolete. It
leaves room for the 71 route to continue existing, in any case.  --  * Russo
Station: Alternatively known as the ""Jesus Fucking Christ Watertown, Get Your
Goddamn Shit Together and Do Whatever You Need to do to Save Russo's"" Station,
this would be named after the century-long staple fresh market everyone in
Greater Boston knows and loves, ideally with a return of said market (I'm still
not over it and neither is anyone I know!). In terms of where exactly it would
be situated, I'm not 100% sure, but the idea would be to optimally serve, yes,
Russo's of course (hopefully guaranteeing a big and bright future for it for
centuries to come), but furthermore everything noteworthy in the vicinity --
From Calvary Cemetery, to the new Watertown Mews, to Gore Place and Walker Pond,
to the River City Plaza, and to all the smaller local businesses around. The
route from Watertown Square could follow either Pleasant/River Street
cut-and-cover or the old Watertown Loop RoW, either way achieves the same effect
so it just depends which is cheaper and more feasible.  --  * Waltham Station:
Here, the extension would intersect with the Wachusett Line of course, serving
Waltham's commuters as well as Moody Street's nightlife. A singular rapid
transit heavy rail connection from Moody Street, to Russo's and the surrounding
area, to the Arsenal, to Harvard Square, I cannot help but imagine holds immense
potential for locals. An infill station could be explored at the old Chemistry
Station site, possibly to serve the high-density lower-income suburban housing
area south of the river and east of Moody Street, but it would feel pretty close
to Waltham Station itself.  --  * Brandeis/Roberts Station: The new terminus!
There's space just past the station, by the river, for a turnaround loop, and
the possibility of closing Brandeis/Roberts on the Wachusett Line could be
explored to cut time on trips from Wachusett to Boston and vice versa. Riders
would then naturally transfer at Waltham Center Station, and again, I can't help
but think that in general a single rapid transit heavy rail connection from
Brandeis University to Russo's and the surrounding area, Watertown Square, the
Arsenal, Mt. Auburn Hospital, and Harvard has near-infinite potential. Both Mt.
Auburn Hospital and Mass General Hospital could better partner with Brandeis
University for medical and social work internships and the like, while Moody
Street and possibly a further developed Arsenal as well as the direct connection
to Harvard Square could offer massive nightlife opportunities for students if
they're well-capitalized on. Taking it one step further, this would put UMass
Boston, MIT, Harvard University, and Brandeis University all on one single rapid
transit corridor, better connecting Brandeis University to Greater Boston's
overall higher-education ""world"". Hell, with some creative civil engineering
(lol) Bentley could splurge for a spur between Russo Station and Waltham Station
coming through somewhere across Linden Street, Access Road, and Beaver Brook,
though that's a whole additional enormous stretch and a simple shuttle to
Waltham and/or Russo Station would probably suffice. Riverbend, Mugar Square,
and Watertown Square Stations all also offer connections to more suburban areas
which could house students easily granting them a quick ride to class from home,
and with Russo's on the system and how fresh and health-conscious it was, both
students and the hospitals could see a massive boon as well.  Obviously, I know,
I know, this'll never happen in a billion years because building transit in the
USA and especially in Boston is borderline impossible these days. But if our
systems and transit infrastructure were much smoother, akin to some in Europe or
in Japan... Maybe something like this could be something we'd get. A guy can
dream! Tell me this wouldn't be kind of a dream come true, though, with how many
major population centers and hotspots a branch like this would connect and
service.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"RLX Branch Suggestion from Harvard to Brandeis/Roberts... via Mt. Auburn, Arsenal, Watertown Square, and... Russo's (RIP!). I've been a low-key transit nerd most of my life; I remember being a kid and
asking for my own street map atlases (remember those old Arrow brand ones) after
seeing my Dad's, and getting them, and drawing railroad extensions all over
their pages. Been seeing a lot of futureMBTA maps lately and what-could-bes and
what-could-have-beens, been following the space since the days of
vanshookenraggen at least. Have a lot of thoughts on the matter; Thought I'd
toss my hat in the ring for some extension ideas. Here's a first for an RLX
branch off Harvard... maybe there'll be more.  **RED LINE**  This is the line
I've thought about the most. Southwards it's pretty set; One could argue the
Mattapan Trolley should be converted to heavy rail and fully integrated into the
rest of the line, but I'm mainly focused on completely new lines here. I've long
thought a branch coming off Harvard would bring lots of benefit, and I've put a
lot of thought over some years into what it could look like. Here's what I think
would be the best for it to look like.  --  *Harvard Extension Branch*  *
Riverbend Station: Northwards (well, westwards, really), starting from Harvard,
this line would run under Mt Auburn Street with a stop at Riverbend, just past
Longfellow Park. This could both serve the Mt. Auburn Hospital as well as
Longfellow Park and by extension the LDS Church, as well as the Riverview
Condominiums and other dense housing in the area. As you'll read below, the LDS
Church, with all its focus on genealogy and respect of our ancestors and
deceased relatives, would probably also benefit from a direct connection to
*four* cemeteries (at least! -- four by my count, anyways) -- Mt. Auburn
Cemetery and Cambridge Cemetery (which of course it already has via the 71 &amp;
73), but then Calvary and Mt. Feake as well.  --  * Mugar Square Station:
Continuing onwards to the intersection with the Watertown-Cambridge Greenway (on
the old Watertown Loop RoW), there'd be a second station around there. Off
admittedly only a little preliminary research, the Mugar family are prominent
philanthropists in the Boston area who've seemingly supported lots of quality
causes over the decades, and their fortune originates in Star Market. Not only
that, but some of its members are buried in Mt. Auburn Cemetery, and they were
longtime residents of Belmont and Watertown. It's just an idea, but it could
make a lot of sense, maybe, to name this intersection/area in their honor --
It's where the Mt. Auburn Cemetery is, as well as a Star Market. An alternate
name here would obviously be ""Mt. Auburn,"" though my hesitation to just go for
that out the gate is the confusion it could create with Riverbend Station, which
would be the ideal stop for the Mt. Auburn Hospital. In any case, the Mugar
Square station would service the Mt. Auburn Cemetery of course, as well as
encourage further development of the space the old Star Market currently
occupies. I have nothing against a supermarket there, but it's flat and wide
with an enormous parking lot; Much could be done with that space in this day and
age, and possibly even the space between the Star Market all the way to Aberdeen
Ave. There's a big mix of old and new there that could all be redeveloped into
much more efficient use of the acreage, perhaps even built around the new
station or with it in mind. And hell, maybe naming it after the Mugars secures

and Watertown Malls. With the Arsenal recently redeveloped and becoming far more

TrackMap](https://www.vanshnookenraggen.com/_index/docs/Boston_MBTA_TrackMap.pdf)
and Google Maps. Subway Builder is still in beta, so there were some limitations
in how I could recreate the real system and still have it work. This should be
thought of as being accurate to the Right-of-Ways used by the MBTA, and roughly
accurate to how the physical tracks are laid out. The order from deepest to
shallowest should always be correct for stacked tunnels at least. I used the
posted service frequencies from the [MBTA's
website](https://www.mbta.com/schedules) to assign number of cars per line, but
had to reduce D and E trains due to overcrowding.  Yards recreated:  *
Southhampton &amp; Cabot yards * Inner Belt carhouse &amp; Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility * The Grand Junction &amp; Beacon yard * Orient Heights
yard * Bowdoin yard * Readville yard * Reservoir carhouse * Wellington carhouse
Disused tunnels:  * Tracks under Tremont St to the former Pleasant St portal *
Tracks between current Green Line tracks that led to the former Boylston St
portal * Former tracks under the abandoned Haymarket Sq Green Line platform *
Tracks south of Harvard to the former Eliot yard portal  Notable issues:  * The
Red Line incline between Park St and Charles/MGH want able to fit in-game, so I
had to snake it around. * The Green Line incline between North Station and
Science Park is the same situation, just more extreme. * In-game routing is not
happy with the Green Line's 100+ year old trackage, and does some double-backs
along the route (Notably the B branch to Reservoir). Also occurs with the Silver
Line. * The game doesn't have curved stations, causing issues in various places.
* All Commuter Rail lines terminate at the edge of the calculated in-game area.
The Needham and Fairmount lines both terminate within the map boundaries. * The

1o4spco,Is there any push to install automatic doors across the entirety of the Commuter Rail?,"To have a busy regional rail system in 2025 where - for the most part -
passenger car doors have to be manually opened and closed by conductors is a
little embarrassing.   This issue creates the most problems during off-peak
times. I’ve stood on platforms with fellow passengers hustling up and down the
platform trying to figure out how and where to board, trying to locate the
conductor, etc. I’ve even seen folks who don’t know any better try to reach up
and open doors from the outside themselves. Obviously you’re not supposed to do
that, but apart from the conductors’ shouted instructions, there is often no
signage or automated announcements telling people how and where to board.
Getting off the train at a non-terminus station can also be a mess. Passengers
don’t know where the conductor is, people are whipping their heads around trying
to clock where other passengers are going to get off the train, and once the
train stops, passengers are hustling down the aisles from car to car trying to
find the conductor or the nearest open door - again with little to no signage.
Sometimes conductors will announce that passengers can only exit the train at a
door manned by the conductor, but that doesn’t tell people much if you haven’t
seen the conductor for the last 20 minutes and have no idea where they/their
door is in relation to where you are on the train. And the P.A. systems are

Representatives across the subway system to prevent riders from piggybacking
paying riders or jumping fare gates. Transit Police will also be deployed to
assist Fare Engagement Representatives in case of an emergency or belligerent
rider.  Fare Engagement Representatives will be patrolling high-traffic stations
and watching for violations. They will also be onboard Red, Blue, and Orange
Lines trains to validate fares on machines. Passengers will be required to tap
their mobile wallet, payment card, or CharlieCard to validate that they paid
their fare.  The MBTA said this is an ongoing effort to provide a safe system
and to support ongoing maintenance across the system (the MBTA has estimated
that they have lost thousands of dollars annually due to fare evasion across the
entire MBTA system).    VIA THE MBTA:  **WHAT ARE THE F.E.R?**  * Fare
Engagement Representatives wear blue shirts, khaki pants, hats, have MBTA
identification, and have access to Google Translate at all times (the majority
of Representatives speak a second language in addition to English).   * They
will enforce payment of subway and bus fares, support riders who may need help
paying their fare, and provide general travel assistance.  * Fare Engagement
Representatives will be deployed based on ridership, not geography, to prevent
potential racism and discriminatory targeting of riders. They have also been
trained in cultural sensitivity, de-escalation strategies, implicit bias, and
data collection transparency.  * Future phases of the Fare Engagement Program
will include Representatives onboard buses, Green Line trolleys, and Mattapan
Line trolleys to verify fare payment and provide riders fare education.
**HOW WILL FARE EVASION BE PROSECUTED?**  * Riders who are caught fare evading
will receive a formal warning on paper with a reiteration of paying their fare.
* Riders who continue to fare evade after being warned will be charged a $50
fine for their first three evasion, then a $100 fine for any subsequent evasion.
* Fines may go up to $150, depending on the severity of the charge.  * Riders
will be required to provide a government-issued identification (such as a
driver’s license or passport) or their name, their phone number, and address to
the Fare Engagement Representative. A citation/fine will be issued to the
rider’s address and provided in-person.  * After passengers are fined/cited,
they will be allowed to continue riding unless they become noncompliant.   *
Riders who become aggressive or noncompliant (i.e: not providing ID or name when
asked) will be asked to leave the station/train or face an arrest/fine for
trespassing.   **WHAT ABOUT USING SOMEONE ELSE’S REDUCED FARE CARD?**  * This
will also result in a fine/citation and is more severe.   * First time offenders
will receive a warning and the reduced fare card will be taken away.   * The
first 3 citations will result in a $75 dollar fine. Subsequent citations will
result in a $150 fine.  **HOW CAN I PAY/WAIVE A FARE?**  * You can pay online,
calling 1-800-941-9716, or sending a check to the MBTA.  * Riders who cannot pay
their fine can have it waived due to financial difficulties by writing an appeal
to the MBTA or attend an appeal hearing with a MBTA representative.  * Riders
asking for an appeal hearing must attend it and provide any needed
documentation. The MBTA will then provide a ruling within 60 by mail/email.  *

to New Bedford, the fall river trains don't seem to have this issue as badly.

off our train. Bikes should be for people who using them to commute not for
juveniles without parents to go into the city and cause chaos. I wish the MBTA
would just ban bikes on all south side trains but I know that isn't fare for
people who actually use the bikes how they supposed to. I think there needs to
be a lot more enforcement of juveniles without parents getting onboard
especially with bikes. And again this isn't the first and will probably be the
last time the train is like this, almost every weekend it's been like this and
it's mostly caused me not to ride because I don't really feel safe especially
when they start riding around on the platforms and in the main hall. The
security at South station is a joke and really need something like NYC where
they have national guard members to make sure this stuff doesn't happen. Not to

this service can encourage state to make upgrade to Cape Bridge that will make

would be mostly the same ie:  NYC (will cover this later on), New Haven, New

type of service would require approval from Army Corps of Engineer for bridge

work be required on Cape to support this? Would Hyannis station area require
additional track work to store both the Amtrak service and Cape Flyer in the
summer?   The train would mostly be on NEC rail but then use Middleboro

1m6uiyv,Massterlist | Leaving the station: T takes key step on commuter rail contract,"I read an interesting article on Massterlist today. It mentions several
companies that attended an ""Industry Day"" hosted by the MBTA in May. Those
companies include, but are not limited to: Alstom, Deutsche Bahn, Transport UK,
Transdev, Herzog, and Alternate Concepts Inc., the company headed by James
O’Leary, who lost the current contract to Keolis Commuter Rail Services in 2014.
(I believe O'Leary used to run Massachusetts Bay Commuter Rail Company).
Additonally, I found it interesting that Keolis has spent $430,000 on lobbyists,
making them one of the top spenders on Beacon Hill.   How likely is it a new
operator would be awarded the contract? Is it likely to change things for the
positive or are the issues most of us experience more structural with the MBTA
itself? What do you think of the current pool we know of?

warning](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2025-06-24/gbh-daily-too-too-hot).
Mayor Michelle Wu declared a heat emergency for the city through Tuesday.  At

stale air this morning.  “It’s fricking hot!” said Brockton resident Debbie

waited for a train. Scott appreciated that there were several fans placed
throughout the station to help provide relief to passengers, but she said they
weren’t enough.  Her message to T leaders? “Come down here and try to take a
train down here and see how hot it is for real!”  Alex Boruchgeruszeki, a recent
transplant to Boston, compared the T station to other subway systems he’s used
around the globe. He had one word to describe the stale air: boiling.  “Here
it’s probably the most uncomfortable of the metro stations that I’ve been in,”
he said. “Something must be done for this city.”  The MBTA on Monday [issued an

crews “around the system to provide assistance” to riders in need. The advisory
also warned that skyrocketing temperatures could lead to operational issues.
“The MBTA may need to operate trains at reduced speeds in some areas to ensure
safety as we compensate for heat-related stress on the tracks, which could
result in slightly longer travel times,” the agency said.  The T did not
immediately respond to an email asking for additional details about the
assistance being offered but said that they are planning a surprise for Blue
Line riders to help them beat the heat.  “MBTA staff will hand out cool treats

1jkzvpr,RE: Addressing recent issues with violence/racism in posts regarding smoking on Red Line,"Hello, everyone. I hope that everyone’s week has been going well.  Today, I
would like to comment on 2 posts that had been shared on the r/mbta subreddit
regarding a teenager (supposedly aged 16) being body-slammed by an adult after
refusing to not smoke weed on a Red Lien train at JFK/UMass and another person
smoking weed on the Red Line.  We have seen an increase in users condoning the
violence that the teenager faced or worse, being generally rude/inappropriate,
saying racist things, etc.   The Moderation Team will not tolerate any of these
behaviors in posts or comments. Discussions about a topic should remain about
the issue at hand while being mature and civil. You are allowed to argue your
own point, as long as it doesn’t violate any subreddit or website
guidelines/rules and remains respectful of all other members.  When people
decide to say that a 16 year old kid should have been assaulted, or be racist,
or be rude to each other, it takes away from any meaningful conversation that
could help prevent such situations in the first place. Violence is NEVER okay
(unless your life is in grave danger), especially against a literal child. There
are better ways to address the situation than trying to be a vigilante; that is
why we have Transit Police and intercom machines. It puts you, the train, other
passengers, and the person you are assaulting in danger. It is not worth it.
The Moderation Team will continue to look at both posts in question and remove
comments that violate Reddit or r/mbta rules. If people continue to repeat

I hope that everyone’s week has been going well.  Today, I
would like to comment on 2 posts that had been shared on the r/mbta subreddit
regarding a teenager (supposedly aged 16) being body-slammed by an adult after
refusing to not smoke weed on a Red Lien train at JFK/UMass and another person
smoking weed on the Red Line.  We have seen an increase in users condoning the
violence that the teenager faced or worse, being generally rude/inappropriate,
saying racist things, etc.   The Moderation Team will not tolerate any of these
behaviors in posts or comments. Discussions about a topic should remain about
the issue at hand while being mature and civil. You are allowed to argue your
own point, as long as it doesn’t violate any subreddit or website
guidelines/rules and remains respectful of all other members.  When people
decide to say that a 16 year old kid should have been assaulted, or be racist,
or be rude to each other, it takes away from any meaningful conversation that
could help prevent such situations in the first place. Violence is NEVER okay
(unless your life is in grave danger), especially against a literal child. There
are better ways to address the situation than trying to be a vigilante; that is
why we have Transit Police and intercom machines. It puts you, the train, other
passengers, and the person you are assaulting in danger. It is not worth it.
The Moderation Team will continue to look at both posts in question and remove
comments that violate Reddit or r/mbta rules. If people continue to repeat
behaviors that have been mentioned before, we will have to begin banning people;
we would rather not have to do that. We want the subreddit to monitor itself,

1j3qqkt,"BREAKING NEWS | State watchdog agency calls out MBTA and Keolis over running of the Commuter Rail, failure to collect fares in new report by State Auditor DiZoglio and Inspector General Shapiro.","REPORTED BY BOSTON GLOBE:  Shapiro penned a public letter to MBTA general
manager Phil Eng urging action to improve fare collection on commuter rail
trains. Less than an hour later, DiZoglio’s office published a 70-page audit
report that the Methuen Democrat said found “significant issues that need to be
remedied” in the contract with Keolis.  Shapiro said he believes the scale of
uncollected fares on commuter rail trains, and the revenue lost as a result,
“has been greatly understated over the years.” He reported that, anecdotally,
staff in the inspector general’s office tracked how often their fares were
collected while riding trains to and from South Station in 2024 and found
significant fluctuation. Every rider from the inspector general’s office took at
least one commuter rail trip during which a conductor did not collect a fare,
Shapiro said.  “In many ways, the MBTA has not prioritized fare collection, as
demonstrated by the lack of infrastructure to achieve that goal and the
treatment of fare collection as an element of the passenger experience rather
than the necessary revenue driver it should be,” he wrote. “The MBTA incorrectly
focuses on fare evasion, when it should instead enforce the contract
requirements of active fare collection by its commuter rail operator. While the
lost revenue from uncollected fares would not close the MBTA’s projected budget
gap, the impact of uncollected fares is significant. How the MBTA leadership and
staff treat one public dollar is as meaningful as how they treat a million
dollars. Each dollar must count.”  The contract allows the T to impose penalties
on Keolis if the company fails to collect fares at expected levels. However,
Shapiro argued that the penalties are too low at $500 per failure, compared to
$1,000 fines for poor vehicle performance or $2,000 fines for station
cleanliness issues.  Shapiro noted that a 2017 agreement between the T and
Keolis called for installation of fare gates at South Station, North Station and
Bay Bay Station, which officials at the time said would increase the T’s revenue
by $24 million.  “We are now in 2025, and the only commuter rail station with
fare gates is North Station,” Shapiro wrote. “The MBTA’s thinking about fare
gates and fare collection needs to change.”  T officials last year said fare
gates have not yet been installed at South Station because of ongoing
construction in air rights above the station. At the time, Eng said scans for
mobile mTickets increased more than 200 percent from September 2023 to September
2024.  DiZoglio’s probe, which her office says will be part of a series of
audits into the MBTA, found that the T mishandled performance-based incentives
and penalties outlined in its contract with Keolis. The errors diminish “the
overall quality and reliability of the MBTA’s commuter rail services,” the audit
said.  “In this instance, the MBTA failed to assess millions of dollars of
financial penalties that could have helped improve service for MBTA customers,”
the audit continued. “This represents a financial loss to the MBTA and could
lead to other financial losses, as poorer service may result in fewer riders.
Failure to properly assess incentives and penalties could also reduce the
public’s trust in the MBTA and harm its relationship with a vendor that relied
on the MBTA’s calculations of incentives and penalties.”  Across the audit
period from June 1, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2023, the MBTA failed to assess more
than $3.3 million in penalties and “inappropriately assessed” another roughly
$258,000 in penalties, based on metrics such as on-time performance, seat
availability, fleet maintenance and passenger comfort and amenities, the report
said. The MBTA overpaid Keolis $105,800 in performance-based incentives, with
the majority of that amount tied to an “inadvertent clerical error,” the audit
found. Keolis was also underpaid $105,210 for train staffing incentives.  In its
audit response, the MBTA said it has started to implement some of the auditor’s
recommendations to ensure the correct penalties and incentives are doled out to
Keolis. The MBTA also said it disagreed “with some of the SAO’s calculations and
interpretations of contract language.” “We look forward to working with the SAO
on how the MBTA can continue to improve to provide safe, reliable, and
accessible service to the MBTA’s customers and employees,” the MBTA said.
DiZoglio’s office said the MBTA did not properly oversee Keolis’s fare
collection efforts and maintain inspection documents. The audit further faulted
the MBTA for not ensuring Keolis submitted required reports on time dealing with
fare collection revenue and fleet maintenance. The MBTA didn’t charge Keolis
$255,000 for the tardy reports, the audit claimed.  “The MBTA disagrees that it
failed to ensure the Keolis submitted reports relating to fare collection
revenue and fleet maintenance on time and as such disagrees that any penalties
were appropriate to be assessed to Keolis,” the agency said in its response to
the audit.  The report made by Auditor DiZoglio can be found here:

1ipptvo,MBTA confirms four-car Red Line trains,"It’a been discussed, but there was not formal confirmation I don’t think.
https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AxgSdcBf1/?mibextid=wwXIfr  From the MBTA
Department of System-wide Accessibility,   ""Dear Riders,  We are writing to
inform you of a change to typical Subway Operations on the Red Line.
Specifically, the MBTA will begin periodically running shorter, four-car
trainsets to supplement the standard six-car trainsets.  Why is this happening?
The MBTA is in the process of retiring its oldest Red Line train cars. While new
Red Line cars continue to be received, there are not enough spare cars to
regularly meet service demands as a result, there may be instances when the MBTA
must run four-car trains to maintain current service levels, particularly during
peak A.M. and P.M. service hours.  When and how often will shorter trainsets be
deployed? This will largely depend on how many cars are available to be put into
passenger service, but riders can expect to find one to three shorter trainsets
in service during the weekday rush beginning over the course of the next few
weeks.    What steps will be taken to ensure a safe and positive experience for
all riders? We recognize that running a combination of six and four car
trainsets will be a significant change for riders – particularly for those who
regularly board cars towards the rear of the train. With this in mind, the
following steps will be taken:  As a shorter train car is approaching the
station, a message will be broadcast both audibly and visually letting riders
know the train will be shorter and that they should move towards the front of
the train while standing behind the yellow line, An additional MBTA employee
will be stationed in the rear car of the shorter trainsets. Their role will be
to scan the platform as the train enters the station and ensure that everyone
waiting towards the end of the platform is aware of the need to move further
down the platform to board. At high ridership stations, employees will be
present on the platform to ensure riders are aware of incoming shorter
trainsets. Have Any Questions? If you have any questions regarding this change,
please contact our Customer Service Center by calling 617-222-3200 (711 for TTY

1imj7on,Praise for (new) #4 CRRC Red Line Car,"I live off the Braintree Branch and don’t have a car atm, commute to DTX for
work - I take the RL if I go anywhere. Whenever signal issues haven’t caused
issues, since the TIP completion the RL on Braintree branch has been super fast
- but seldom do we ever see the new cars. Well over a year ago when I worked as
a contractor for the T doing vehicle maintenance stats there were only ten #4
cars in the active fleet but there must be more now.  I just want to say it’s a
pleasure to be on the new cars. Recent posts from motorpersons and passengers
have brought up issues w the CRRC cars which seem valid, I agree with them,
especially the relative discomfort of the seats. But this feels grand, like I’m
back in NYC riding on one of the many new trains. Or like the OL (which I only
use occasionally) with the new #14s - but the spaciousness of the RL #4 is
dramatic. It’s like of like taking a lettered-route train in NYC (BMT/IND) if
you’re accustomed to the numbered trains (previously IRT) as everything inside
looks the same except the dimensions are obviously very different. In this
respect I’m talking about the width, how much space between the the seats on
either side. The new orange line cars are good but feel a little squeezed when
it’s busy ( let’s not blame the MBTA or CRRC for this).   Speaking of, I believe
in nyc they called the numbered routes the “A Division” and lettered routes the
“B Division” - some non official maps I’ve seen made by fellow trolley jollies
depict the RL branches using this same A / B nomenclature which I think is
sensible because Ashmont starts with A, Braintree with B. I grew up using
Alewife as my station to enter the system and never had been to Braintree,
Mattapan, Ashmont, so while this all seems simple enough to me now maybe “A” and
“B” would be simpler. The #3 RL cars seem to have the same side LCD displays as
the R42 old nyc trains also rehabbed in the 90s by Kawasaki (or Bombadier?) and
in nyc it shows the letter/number of route big and then the terminus -
Ashmont-bound trains in Boston show a big “A” there too but I’ve never seen them
use a “B” there. I never used the “south shore extension” when I was working for
the T so I never thought to ask.   My real point is that I could see the future
being bright when the RL fleet is finally new, even with all the issues of the
CRRC trains; if the orange line is an indication, it doesn’t seem to be a
disaster the way the Boeing LRVs were in the 80s, requiring replacement well

bay, I want to give my 2 cents about how the fare gates will benefit riders
&amp; why were better off with them. 1. Everyone feels confident knowing their
fares are being collected.  If everyone is forced to have a valid ticket or
pass, then we all know everybody is paying their fares. In a time where no one
knows what's happening at the federal level, every dollar of fare revenue
counts.   2. Limit bad behavior. I was at south station Saturday night &amp;
unfortunately we were stuck dealing with people riding bikes around the
concourse &amp; outside the building on the platform area. If you dont have a
valid ticket or pass, you wont be as capable of bothering paying customers. In
this case, they got on my train so it wont work all the time, but it  should cut
down that behavior.  3. Promoting reduced fares has a positive impact &amp;
means more people can afford the fare across the system. With the fare
engagement staff providing information about the options for reduced fares, more
people are learning about it &amp; might utilize it, allowing them to pay a fare
they can afford while not having to worry about being called out for fare
evading or missing out on transit options.  According to this streetsblog
article from last November, applications for the low income program have reached
over 13k. Its a safe bet that the numbers have only gone up since. That doesn't
count the other ways riders can qualify for a reduced fare card.

1mnfslf,Setting the record straight: Providence Line electrification,"This is in response to a post I saw earlier today but honestly this topic comes
up so often I’m just gonna make a post. Whenever the topic of Providence Line
electrification comes up, there’s usually a chorus of “the wires are already
there, just buy electric trains!” In reality, upgrading the Providence Line for
regular electric service is one of the most misunderstood MBTA projects. Yes, it
should be electrified, but the barriers are significant, and right now the MBTA
has neither the funding nor the institutional capacity to pursue it. I’ve listed
what I think are the biggest barriers, but there’s probably many more since if
there *were* a clear path to electric service the MBTA *probably* would have
already done it.   1. Amtrak owns the catenary, not the MBTA. The overhead wires
between Boston and Providence are part of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor (NEC)
infrastructure. Amtrak maintains them primarily for intercity service, and while
MBTA can operate under them, it has no say in maintenance schedules, renewal
cycles, or capital improvements. Any MBTA electrification project would require
negotiated agreements with Amtrak, which can be lengthy, expensive, and
politically complex.  2. No FRA-compliant facilities for maintaining electric
trains. Electric locomotives and EMUs require specialized maintenance shops with
high-voltage safety protocols, insulated tooling, and overhead clearance for
live wire work. The MBTA has no FRA-compliant facility set up for electric
motive power. This means either retrofitting existing yards (Readville,
Southampton, Pawtucket, etc.) at great expense, or building entirely new
facilities, which is far from cheap in the Boston metro area (look no further
than what is proposed for Readville and Widett).  3. Many sidings, station
tracks, and storage tracks lack electrification. Even on the NEC itself, dozens
of miles of auxiliary tracks used by MBTA aren’t wired. South Station’s layover
and approach sidings would need electrification. The station tracks south of
Providence, used for layovers and passing moves, also lack catenary. Without
wiring these, MBTA trains couldn’t operate fully electric without major
operational changes.  4. Rolling stock acquisition is a major hurdle. The MBTA
is not in a position to buy electric locomotives or EMUs right now (Fairmount
BEMUs are being handled by Keolis, not the T). Providence Line electrification
would require the largest fleet of electric trains of any MBTA line. Even if the
MBTA purchased ACS-64 locomotives (like Amtrak), its bilevel coach fleet would
need significant electrical modifications to be compatible. That’s a major cost
multiplier.  5. Platform height is the other half of the problem. A major reason
Providence Line service is slower and less reliable than it could be isn’t just
diesel power, it’s the lack of full level boarding at most stations. Converting
every station to high-level platforms (full length ADA-compliant, fully
accessible) would be transformative for dwell times and reliability, even if
service remained diesel. This upgrade alone is a massive, multi-year capital
project.  6. Cost is not pocket change, we’re talking $1B+. A realistic low-end
estimate for electrifying the Providence Line for MBTA service is at least $1
billion in capital upgrades, probably much more once you include new/modified
maintenance facilities, electrification of sidings and layover, rolling stock
procurement, station rebuilds for high-level boarding, and negotiated access and
cost-sharing with Amtrak.  The Providence Line should be electrified, it’s the
MBTA’s best candidate for it, and the NEC wires are indeed already there. But
the reality is that the MBTA is in no fiscal position to pursue the upgrades,
has not indicated any intention to do so, and faces enormous logistical and
technical barriers before a single electric train could run in regular commuter

1mjjymw,Will we focus more on cr in 2026?,"With all the focus on the rapid transit system over the last few years, will the
t get more aggressive in the coming years with fixing &amp; upgrading the cr?
Some work has already begun at certain stations, like upgrading natick center
&amp; Winchester. With fifa coming to town next year, i thought a post from
r/transit was fitting. You can find it below.   If we put this much effort into
making Foxboro station better, could we be on the cusp of a systemic change in
how the commuter rail is operated? We could get a new operator if keolis looses
the contract which could mean major improvements. If that happens, we could
focus on getting more riders off the roads &amp; into trains. A post yesterday
made a point to say that if ridership is plateuing, why aren't more people
riding instead of driving as viable alternatives.   Many coments expressed
dissatisfaction with the schedules &amp; frequencies. I agree that's something
that needs improvement. We cant accomplish that without investing in the system.
Its a chicken &amp; egg problem. People want improvements but won't ride the
trains, thus the ridership isnt there to justify said improvements. I hope we
experience more emphasis on the commuter rail in the coming years by offering
realistic, accessible improvements that aren't smoke &amp; mirrors.   R/transit

1l2wglg,Another MBTA Fantasy Expansoion,"When [According-Manner2770](https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Manner2770/)
posted a fantasy map for the MBTA, it looked like fun. So I spent a couple of
hours playing with [Brand New Subway](https://jpwright.github.io/subway/) to
create some wonderful new service around Boston.  I played under the following
assumptions:  1. I wasn't going to use my capital budget to run subways parallel
to commuter rail. Once you get beyond the urban core, the optimal solution is
frequent regional rail service. (Sorry, the Blue Line isn't going to Lynn or
Salem, but you will be able to make a connection to the subways.) 2. In honor of
Mayor Jeannette A. McCarthy of Waltham, I created a Brown Line Monorail. [She
pitched it at a TedX
Talk](https://patch.com/massachusetts/waltham/mayor-suggests-bringing-monorail-city-waltham-tedx).
The McCarthy Monorail will run along Route 128 and will connect with all
Regional Rail and subway lines. Note that my subways will not extend out beyond
the McCarthy Monorail, with the exception of the Braintree stop on the Red Line,
as the logical connector from the southern end of the Red Line to the McCarthy
Monorail is at Quincy Adams. 3. Needham is outside the McCarthy Monorail
boundary, and Needham is fighting against the MBTA Communities Act, so that
really nice Orange Line extension through Roslindale and West Roxbury will
terminate at Route 128. I replace the trains into Needham Center with a really
nice Bus Rapid Transit route that will connect to the Orange Line terminal and
to the Newton Highlands stop on the Green Line. 4. I was looking to fill
corridors without any rail service, so the Red Line is extended through
Arlington Center and Lexington to connect with the McCarthy Monorail in
Burlington. Twenty years ago the state added a lane to Route 3 without finding a
place for all those cars to go when they reach Burlington. A nice big garage
with easy highway access will fix that problem. 5. Then I started to look at
places that would really benefit from trains but are in a rail wilderness. Blue
Hill Avenue from Mattapan. Columbia Road. Chelsea. Medford Square. Watertown.
And the holy grail, the terminals at Logan Airport. So I pulled out a teal
crayon and started at Route 128 in Westwood (and the beloved McCarthy Monorail),
and ran the line up the Northeast Corridor to Hyde Park, then diverted to
Mattapan. I ran the line up Blue Hill and Columbia Road, through the heart of
South Boston, and on to Logan. Then the crayon wanted to head through Wellington
to Medford Square, Alewife, and on to Watertown. From there, I did bring it
through Waltham and parallel to the Regional Rail to meet the McCarthy Monorail,
because Jeannette should have a really good connection to her monorail. I
doubled the frequency of service on the Teal Line between Watertown Square and
Mattapan, and marked that part of the route in yellow. 6. Other notes. I
extended the Green Line from Medford/Tufts to Mystic Valley Parkway and a
connection to the Teal Line. I extended the Orange Line across the line to
Wyoming Avenue in Melrose, because I thought it would be fun to have a transit
line that goes to Wyoming. I included the Red-Blue connector at Charles-MGH, and
restored Green Line service between Heath Street and Forest Hills. Red Line
trains from Braintree will terminate at Arlington Heights, Ashmont trains will
make the trip out to Burlington.  It was fun. Sadly, I now must return to
reality and the crappy bus service that is now running where there should be
trains.

at Wellington Station. I was focused on finding my friend who was picking me up.
So, I got to the top of the escalator, and, halfway through the skywalk bridge I
suddenly  realized something wasn't right. My old, worn, sage green Adidas
backpack was gone! I retraced all my steps. I asked the employees, strangers,
tourists, people's dogs....everyone...'have you seen my backpack?' No one did,
of course. So I called the MBTA's lost and found #, and when I called they said
they couldn't deal with lost items right now because the orange line was having
signal problems. (What one has to do with the other....I have no clue!).  I
think I absent-mindedly left it on the train (one with ""all new orange line
cars"" northbound to Oak Grove, got off at wellington at around 10:25am), or on
the center platform at Wellington. Usually things that get left behind in public
get scooped up, one way or another. The only thing I can't replace is my
medications. I've had this happen before. At least all my money and all my cards
were in my pocket. I also had a locked galaxy phone that's like 5 years old in
there, notebooks, tax documents, a black hoodie, pens, crochet hooks, some
tools, and an umbrella. No cash or credit cards.   If someone finds it with my
stuff still in it, I'll give you a reward. I have a seizure disorder and need my
medications. I can't get any of them replaced (because I've already had lost
meds replaced several times. Im a total lummox!   I really appreciate people's
kindness, and I think it's wonderful when someone is willing to unselfishly help
out a stranger. I would be so grateful if someone found it! I think most people
are pretty decent and would do the right thing, but who knows?  Any suggestions

1jhb4v6,Copley Bus lane is a complete own goal,"The city of Boston destroyed a bus lane this past week, taking it out of
commission less than one year after it was installed. Mayor Wu explained her
reasoning in a letter to the Back Bay Association, and it makes no sense.
*“Based on observational analysis reinforcing community feedback following the
permanent installation in July 2024, the dedicated bus lane has not functioned
as intended to justify the space allocation. In addition to buses often not
having a clear path of travel, the bus lane is regularly used for driving and
parking on parts of the street that are very constrained serving area
businesses, hotels, and the Boston Public Library.”*  After supposedly poor
performance, the bus lane is being removed because it takes up too much space.
But what has its performance been? Well, according to [Transit
Matters ](https://transitmatters.org/blog/media-statement-calls-upon-the-city-of-boston-to-pause-boylston-street-bus-lane-removal)the
lane has seen 40% reductions in travel times during rush hour in the most
heavily trafficked segments of the route.  That seems pretty good to
[me](https://chasetoday.substack.com/), Mayor Wu seemingly thinks otherwise, but
that’s only a difference of opinion. What is really galling is that she follows
this up by claiming the lane has to go because drivers keep breaking the rules
and undermining the point of the separated lane. A bus lane, designed to
separate transit riders from commuter traffic, was determined to be
underperforming **and** hamstrung by rule breakers… so we are just scrapping the
whole thing? That seems pretty backwards. If mayor really wanted the lane to
justify its space, then she would get those damn cars out of the bus lane!
That’s the whole game with a separated lane, its separated!  The city actually
has a real answer for this and blowing up the lane so close to its
implementation makes zero sense. Traffic enforcement cameras on buses are all
the rage these days. Manual enforcement of traffic violations is completely
impractical. You would need a cop or parking enforcement officer on every curb
in the city! It would be madness. But drafting laws to order the street, not
enforcing them, and then throwing up your hands when people don't follow them is
madness too. Traffic cameras solve this problem. Getting double parkers and
traffic cheats out of the way speeds up commutes for everyone, not just buses.
New York has recently had great success with this policy and has seen an almost
complete drop off in repeat offenders.  Massachusetts legalized these cameras
last December, but like everything in this State, implementation of this common
sense idea has been hamstrung by bureaucracy so they aren’t actually operational
yet. But they have never been closer to reality than they are now, and they
solve the exact problem Wu acknowledges.  Why the hell this lane was scrapped
isn’t hard to explain, Mayor Wu would rather sell out to the Back Bay
Association and the wealthiest residents of the city than provide meaningful
improvements to working class Bostonian commuters. This undermines her support
for low income residents, her vision of Boston never backing down, and progress
we have been making on a greener city. Its a complete own goal for no reason
With the Federal Government throwing up on itself under the command of Donald
Trump, I would hoped that Democrats could offer a real counter example. “See,
Republicans don’t know how to govern! Not like us here in Boston, where housing
is expensive, traffic is shit, and we are actively undoing our work to improve

1j3um5i,I asked ChatGPT how to improve MBTA commuter trains and it comes up with a radical idea,"# Introduction: A New Vision for Boston’s Rail Network  Boston’s existing
transit system consists of separate subway lines (Red, Orange, Blue) and
commuter rail lines that converge on South Station or North Station. As a
result, these two major rail terminals operate like dead ends: trains must
terminate and reverse direction, causing congestion, longer travel times, and
inconvenient transfers. Inspired by European RER (e.g. Paris) and German S-Bahn
models, as well as the Japanese practice of “through-running” between subways
and suburban railways (e.g. Tokyo, Osaka), this plan envisions integrating
commuter rail with the urban subway system.  Rather than building a single
North-South Rail Link tunnel under downtown, we propose using Boston’s **three
subway lines**—Blue, Orange, and Red—as the primary corridors through the city
center. By extending or creating short connector tracks on both ends of each
subway line, we can allow commuter rail lines to run straight through the urban
core. This approach drastically reduces transfers, relieves congestion at
downtown rail terminals, and establishes a unified “regional express” network.
In addition, we propose upgrading the **Grand Junction Railway (GJR)**—an
existing freight and equipment corridor in Cambridge and Allston—to provide an
alternative cross-city path outside the congested downtown arteries.
Ultimately, the goal is to create **three major through-running axes**:  1.
**Blue Line Axis**: Linking the north shore’s Newburyport/Rockport Line with the
west corridor (Worcester/Framingham). 2. **Orange Line Axis**: Linking the
northern Haverhill/Lowell corridors with the southern Providence/Stoughton and
Franklin/Foxboro lines. 3. **Red Line Axis**: Linking the northwest Fitchburg
corridor with the southeastern Old Colony lines.  Below, we detail how each
subway line is extended or connected to commuter rail, the upgrades required,
and how we will phase in these changes.  # 1. Blue Line Through-Running  #
Northern Extension and Connection  Currently, the Blue Line ends at Wonderland
(in Revere). We propose **extending** it northward to Lynn and constructing a
short connector near Wonderland to tie into the **Newburyport/Rockport commuter
lines**. That way, trains from Rockport or Newburyport could either continue to
North Station as usual, or run straight onto the Blue Line tracks for direct
service into East Boston and downtown.  * **Lynn Terminus**: The Blue Line
itself would run to Lynn as its normal subway endpoint, with high-frequency
local service. * **Wonderland Connector**: Some trains from the
Rockport/Newburyport lines could join the Blue Line near Wonderland, allowing
them to travel into downtown through the existing Blue Line tunnel.  # Southern
Extension and Grand Junction  On the downtown side, we want the Blue Line to
continue beyond Bowdoin or Government Center toward Kendall Square. This is
similar to prior “Red-Blue Connector” concepts, but extends further to connect
with the **Grand Junction Railway (GJR)** near MIT. The GJR, once fully
upgraded, would allow trains to cross the Charles River into Allston and join
the **Worcester/Framingham line**. As a result, those commuter trains could pass
through Cambridge on GJR, switch onto the Blue Line tunnel at Kendall, and
emerge on the north side near Wonderland or Lynn, giving a direct route across
the metropolitan area.  # Operations and Turnbacks  * **City Core Frequency**:
The Lynn–Kendall segment (the Blue Line “core”) can run at intervals of around
5–6 minutes during peak periods. * **Suburban Extensions**: On the
Rockport/Newburyport side, certain long-haul trains might run all the way from
Beverly or Salem through to Worcester; in reality, many trains would short-turn
at Salem or Lynn. * **West Side**: On the Worcester/Framingham side, not all
trains would go downtown via the GJR/Blue Line; some would still end at South
Station. The ones that do through-run would merge onto the Blue Line near
Kendall, run through downtown, and proceed north to Wonderland or Lynn.  In
practice, having a portion of Worcester or Framingham trains follow this path
reduces congestion at South Station and gives riders an alternative route
through Cambridge. Lynn and possibly Framingham would have facilities to
short-turn certain trains or store them when not in service.  # 2. Orange Line
Through-Running  # Northern Connections  The Orange Line currently runs from
Forest Hills in the south through downtown to Oak Grove in the north. Under this
plan:  1. **Haverhill Connection**: Between Community College station and
Sullivan Square, we build a link to the Haverhill commuter line. At that point,
Haverhill trains could enter the Orange Line right-of-way to continue south
through the Orange Line tunnel. 2. **Lowell Connection**: The plan also calls
for a short spur departing the Orange Line near Community College/Sullivan to
connect with the Lowell commuter line. A new “Inner Belt” station would be
created on this spur. As a result, the northern end of the Orange Line could fan
out into two branches: one continuing to Oak Grove (and onward to Haverhill),
and another heading to Lowell via Inner Belt.  # Southern Connections  At the
southern end:  1. **Needham Line Merger**: The short Needham commuter line would
be converted to “Orange Line standards” (full electrification, high platforms,
grade separation) and effectively absorbed into the Orange Line south of Forest
Hills. 2. **Providence/Stoughton + Franklin/Foxboro**: With the addition of a
short connector track (likely near Readville or Hyde Park), trains from the
Providence/Stoughton or Franklin/Foxboro lines could also join the Orange Line.
This allows riders from those lines to travel straight into the city on the
Orange Line corridor.  # Operations and Turnbacks  Because the Orange Line would
handle multiple northern branches (Haverhill, Lowell) and multiple southern
branches (Needham, Providence/Foxboro), the core downtown segment (Oak
Grove–Forest Hills) would see trains arriving from four directions. During peak
hours, you might see frequencies in the range of 3–4 minutes in the trunk. Each
suburban branch might get intervals of 10–15 minutes, partly by short-turning or
skipping certain sections. For instance:  * Some trains on the northern side end
at Oak Grove; others continue onto Haverhill or Lowell. * Some trains on the
southern side end at Forest Hills; others continue onto Needham, Providence, or
Franklin.  High-platform conversions along Haverhill, Lowell, Needham, and other
commuter lines would be needed, as would electrification. Freight usage, where
it exists, would either be re-routed or time-separated.  # 3. Red Line
Through-Running  # Northern Extension  The Red Line ends at Alewife, but we
propose extending it along the old Lexington Branch corridor through Arlington
and Lexington to **Bedford**, near the I-95 highway. This corridor was once
studied in the 1970s but never built. At the same time, near Alewife or Porter
Square, we would build a **connector** linking the Red Line tracks to the
**Fitchburg commuter line** (which usually runs from North Station through
Waltham, Concord, and Fitchburg).  With that connection, trains from Fitchburg
could merge onto the Red Line tunnel near Alewife, run through central Boston
(Harvard, Park Street, Downtown Crossing), and continue south as Red Line
trains—thus bypassing North Station entirely.  # Southern Connection  On the
south side, the Red Line has two branches: Braintree and Ashmont. We propose a
short connector near JFK/UMass or Braintree that links the **Old Colony lines**
(Greenbush, Kingston/Plymouth, Middleborough) into the Red Line. This would
allow certain commuter trains from the South Shore to skip South Station and
instead ride the Red Line corridor straight downtown.  Some Old Colony trains
would still go to South Station, especially from stations beyond I-95 or I-495,
but a portion would join the Red Line for direct service. Meanwhile, the Ashmont
branch could stay as a local subway branch, or in the long run we could link it
to the Fairmount corridor, depending on future planning.  # Operations and
Turnbacks  * **In the core** (e.g., Alewife–JFK-UMass), the Red Line already
runs at high frequency, sometimes 3–4 minutes at peak. Through-running would
require scheduling suburban trains within these slots. We could designate
“express/limited-stop” trains so that the downtown trunk doesn’t become overly
congested. * **Far Suburbs**: Fitchburg is quite long, so half the trains might
only go as far as Waltham or Concord. On the south side, Braintree remains an
important hub: some trains terminate there, some continue on to Plymouth or
Middleborough. * **Ashmont** would largely serve local Red Line frequencies,
possibly unaffected by the new commuter spurs. Over time, we could integrate it
further if desired.  # 4. Grand Junction Railway (GJR) as a Key Link  Currently,
the GJR is a mostly single-track rail corridor crossing Cambridge and Allston,
used largely for freight or non-revenue transfers. By fully **double-tracking
and electrifying** the GJR, and removing freight operations, we can transform it
into a second cross-city path. For instance:  * **Worcester–North Link**: A
train from Worcester could avoid South Station by jumping onto GJR at Allston
(West Station) and then continuing across the Charles near MIT and onward to
North Station or Haverhill. * **Blue Line Connection**: Meanwhile, the Blue Line
southern extension can meet GJR near Kendall Square, offering a downtown tunnel
route for Worcester/Framingham trains. * **Eliminating Freight**: Because GJR
would see frequent passenger traffic, we would end freight usage or reroute it
to other lines, building fences and grade separations along the corridor in
Cambridge.  Upgrading the GJR to passenger-rail standards means building new
stations (MIT, Cambridgeport, etc.), possibly bridging or tunneling to remove
road crossings, and ensuring the line can support 10–15 minute headways in peak
hours.  # 5. Required Infrastructure Upgrades  Below is a concise overview of
what we must do across the network to make these through-running corridors
function smoothly:  1. **Electrification (Dual-Mode)**    * Subway tunnels use
750 V DC via a third rail, while commuter lines typically prefer 25 kV AC
overhead wires for efficiency and speed. We plan to adopt both, so that trains
can automatically switch between overhead power outside the city and third-rail
power in the subway sections. 2. **New Rolling Stock**    * We need modern EMUs
(Electric Multiple Units) that can handle both third rail and overhead systems,
and that fit the profiles of both the subway tunnels and commuter rail lines.
Such dual-power vehicles already exist in other North American systems. 3.
**Platform Reconstruction**    * Subway lines use high-level platforms for
step-free boarding. Many MBTA commuter stations have low platforms. For a single
fleet to serve both, commuter rail stations on the routes designated for
through-running must be retrofitted with **uniform high platforms**. This
ensures level boarding and faster dwell times. 4. **Track Expansion and Grade
Separation**    * Several commuter lines are still single-track or have only
partial double track, so we must add second tracks or build passing sidings to
support higher frequency.    * We must eliminate or bridge over road crossings
to avoid safety risks and slowdowns, especially where trains will run
frequently.    * Certain route junctions, such as Bay Junction near JFK/UMass or
near Forest Hills, require new flyovers to separate crossing movements. 5.
**Signaling and Control**    * Busy urban rail corridors rely on advanced
control systems like CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control) to allow safe
operation at minimal headways (2–3 minutes). The entire through-running network,
including commuter branches, must integrate with a single dispatch center. 6.
**Park-and-Ride and Transfer Hubs**    * We propose large parking facilities at
stations near I-95 or I-495, where drivers can switch to commuter rail, reducing
highway congestion.    * Key transfer stations—like Kendall (Blue/Red), Forest
Hills (Orange + multiple commuter lines), Alewife (Red + Fitchburg
connection)—will get improved circulation, signage, and universal design
features. 7. **Seaport Coverage**    * By adapting the “Track 61” corridor and
adding a short link at Widett Circle, we can run some trains directly into the
Seaport (e.g., from the Fairmount or Franklin lines). This would open up a
crucial new transit corridor to Boston’s booming waterfront district.  # 6.
Implementation Timeline  Because the plan is ambitious and expensive, it will
unfold in stages:  1. **Phase 1 (1–3 years)**:    * Detailed planning,
feasibility studies, environmental reviews, public outreach.    * Preliminary
engineering for key connectors (Needham into Orange, Blue–Lynn extension,
Red–Blue connector to Kendall, etc.). 2. **Phase 2 (4–8 years)**:    * Begin
**pilot project**: for example, incorporate the Needham Line into the Orange
Line. Temporarily close the Needham commuter branch to rebuild it with
electrification and high platforms.    * Build the connector near Forest Hills.
Acquire a small fleet of dual-mode EMUs. Open “Orange + Needham” as a
demonstration of how city-suburban direct service works.    * Simultaneously
start constructing the Blue Line extension to Lynn. 3. **Phase 3 (9–15 years)**:
* Expand the network by upgrading more lines (e.g., Haverhill, Fitchburg, Old
Colony).    * Complete the Red Line extension to Bedford, plus the Fitchburg
connector near Alewife.    * Upgrade Grand Junction to double-track, electrify
it, and build West Station. Start partial through-service from Worcester to
North Station or Blue Line.    * By the end of Phase 3, each subway line might
have at least one “through route” open. 4. **Phase 4 (16–25 years)**:    *
Finish connecting the Old Colony lines to the Red Line, the Franklin/Providence
lines to the Orange, and the final links for the Blue.    * Install final
missing station improvements, finalize the Seaport coverage with Track 61.    *
Integrate the entire system under a new fare and scheduling framework, so that
commuter rail, through trains, and subway lines are effectively a single
regional system.  Throughout each phase, newly completed segments will yield
immediate benefits—higher frequencies, easier transfers, or direct
suburban-to-city trains. These benefits build momentum and public acceptance,
supporting continued investment. After roughly two decades, Boston would have a
unified rail network where trains from Salem, Lynn, or Beverly can directly run
to Newton or Worcester; riders from Haverhill or Lowell can reach Needham or
Foxboro in one seat; and Fitchburg passengers can travel to Plymouth without
changing trains.  # 7. Conclusion  By extending and adapting the existing MBTA
subway lines—Blue, Orange, and Red—to serve as cross-city trunk corridors for
commuter rail, Boston can solve the long-standing problem of dead-end commuter
rail terminals at North Station and South Station. Instead of investing in a
single large tunnel, we leverage multiple smaller connectors, the Grand Junction
Railway, and modern dual-mode EMU technology to create **a fully integrated
“city-suburban” rail system**.  This approach draws on successful models in
Tokyo and Paris, where suburban trains share tunnels with urban rapid transit,
providing seamless end-to-end journeys. While the operational and engineering
challenges—such as converting lines to high platforms, electrifying them, and
installing advanced signals—are significant, they are entirely feasible with
current technology. The result would be a dramatic improvement in regional
mobility, reduced traffic congestion, and a more accessible, sustainable
metropolitan area.  In time, Boston would move beyond the limitations of
separate subway and commuter rail networks. Commuters would enjoy frequent,
direct rides from suburban stations through the urban core, and overall
ridership would increase as public transit becomes more convenient and reliable.
This plan envisions a 20-year roadmap that fundamentally reshapes how the region
travels, paving the way for the next era of vibrant, coordinated public
transportation in Greater Boston.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"I asked ChatGPT how to improve MBTA commuter trains and it comes up with a radical idea # Introduction: A New Vision for Boston’s Rail Network  Boston’s existing

important hub: some trains terminate there, some continue on to Plymouth or
Middleborough. * **Ashmont** would largely serve local Red Line frequencies,
possibly unaffected by the new commuter spurs. Over time, we could integrate it
further if desired.  # 4. Grand Junction Railway (GJR) as a Key Link  Currently,
the GJR is a mostly single-track rail corridor crossing Cambridge and Allston,
used largely for freight or non-revenue transfers. By fully **double-tracking
and electrifying** the GJR, and removing freight operations, we can transform it
into a second cross-city path. For instance:  * **Worcester–North Link**: A
train from Worcester could avoid South Station by jumping onto GJR at Allston
(West Station) and then continuing across the Charles near MIT and onward to
North Station or Haverhill. * **Blue Line Connection**: Meanwhile, the Blue Line
southern extension can meet GJR near Kendall Square, offering a downtown tunnel
route for Worcester/Framingham trains. * **Eliminating Freight**: Because GJR
would see frequent passenger traffic, we would end freight usage or reroute it
to other lines, building fences and grade separations along the corridor in
Cambridge.  Upgrading the GJR to passenger-rail standards means building new
stations (MIT, Cambridgeport, etc.), possibly bridging or tunneling to remove
road crossings, and ensuring the line can support 10–15 minute headways in peak
hours.  # 5. Required Infrastructure Upgrades  Below is a concise overview of
what we must do across the network to make these through-running corridors
function smoothly:  1. **Electrification (Dual-Mode)**    * Subway tunnels use
750 V DC via a third rail, while commuter lines typically prefer 25 kV AC
overhead wires for efficiency and speed. We plan to adopt both, so that trains
can automatically switch between overhead power outside the city and third-rail
power in the subway sections. 2. **New Rolling Stock**    * We need modern EMUs
(Electric Multiple Units) that can handle both third rail and overhead systems,
and that fit the profiles of both the subway tunnels and commuter rail lines.
Such dual-power vehicles already exist in other North American systems. 3.
**Platform Reconstruction**    * Subway lines use high-level platforms for
step-free boarding. Many MBTA commuter stations have low platforms. For a single
fleet to serve both, commuter rail stations on the routes designated for
through-running must be retrofitted with **uniform high platforms**. This
ensures level boarding and faster dwell times. 4. **Track Expansion and Grade
Separation**    * Several commuter lines are still single-track or have only
partial double track, so we must add second tracks or build passing sidings to
support higher frequency.    * We must eliminate or bridge over road crossings
to avoid safety risks and slowdowns, especially where trains will run
frequently.    * Certain route junctions, such as Bay Junction near JFK/UMass or
near Forest Hills, require new flyovers to separate crossing movements. 5.
**Signaling and Control**    * Busy urban rail corridors rely on advanced
control systems like CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control) to allow safe
operation at minimal headways (2–3 minutes). The entire through-running network,
including commuter branches, must integrate with a single dispatch center. 6.
**Park-and-Ride and Transfer Hubs**    * We propose large parking facilities at
stations near I-95 or I-495, where drivers can switch to commuter rail, reducing
highway congestion.    * Key transfer stations—like Kendall (Blue/Red), Forest
Hills (Orange + multiple commuter lines), Alewife (Red + Fitchburg
connection)—will get improved circulation, signage, and universal design
features. 7. **Seaport Coverage**    * By adapting the “Track 61” corridor and
adding a short link at Widett Circle, we can run some trains directly into the
Seaport (e.g., from the Fairmount or Franklin lines). This would open up a
crucial new transit corridor to Boston’s booming waterfront district.  # 6.
Implementation Timeline  Because the plan is ambitious and expensive, it will
unfold in stages:  1. **Phase 1 (1–3 years)**:    * Detailed planning,
feasibility studies, environmental reviews, public outreach.    * Preliminary
engineering for key connectors (Needham into Orange, Blue–Lynn extension,
Red–Blue connector to Kendall, etc.). 2. **Phase 2 (4–8 years)**:    * Begin
**pilot project**: for example, incorporate the Needham Line into the Orange
Line. Temporarily close the Needham commuter branch to rebuild it with
electrification and high platforms.    * Build the connector near Forest Hills.
Acquire a small fleet of dual-mode EMUs. Open “Orange + Needham” as a
demonstration of how city-suburban direct service works.    * Simultaneously
start constructing the Blue Line extension to Lynn. 3. **Phase 3 (9–15 years)**:
* Expand the network by upgrading more lines (e.g., Haverhill, Fitchburg, Old
Colony).    * Complete the Red Line extension to Bedford, plus the Fitchburg
connector near Alewife.    * Upgrade Grand Junction to double-track, electrify
it, and build West Station. Start partial through-service from Worcester to
North Station or Blue Line.    * By the end of Phase 3, each subway line might
have at least one “through route” open. 4. **Phase 4 (16–25 years)**:    *
Finish connecting the Old Colony lines to the Red Line, the Franklin/Providence
lines to the Orange, and the final links for the Blue.    * Install final
missing station improvements, finalize the Seaport coverage with Track 61.    *
Integrate the entire system under a new fare and scheduling framework, so that
commuter rail, through trains, and subway lines are effectively a single
regional system.  Throughout each phase, newly completed segments will yield
immediate benefits—higher frequencies, easier transfers, or direct
suburban-to-city trains. These benefits build momentum and public acceptance,
supporting continued investment. After roughly two decades, Boston would have a
unified rail network where trains from Salem, Lynn, or Beverly can directly run
to Newton or Worcester; riders from Haverhill or Lowell can reach Needham or
Foxboro in one seat; and Fitchburg passengers can travel to Plymouth without
changing trains.  # 7. Conclusion  By extending and adapting the existing MBTA
subway lines—Blue, Orange, and Red—to serve as cross-city trunk corridors for
commuter rail, Boston can solve the long-standing problem of dead-end commuter
rail terminals at North Station and South Station. Instead of investing in a
single large tunnel, we leverage multiple smaller connectors, the Grand Junction
Railway, and modern dual-mode EMU technology to create **a fully integrated
“city-suburban” rail system**.  This approach draws on successful models in
Tokyo and Paris, where suburban trains share tunnels with urban rapid transit,
providing seamless end-to-end journeys. While the operational and engineering
challenges—such as converting lines to high platforms, electrifying them, and
installing advanced signals—are significant, they are entirely feasible with
current technology. The result would be a dramatic improvement in regional
mobility, reduced traffic congestion, and a more accessible, sustainable
metropolitan area.  In time, Boston would move beyond the limitations of
separate subway and commuter rail networks. Commuters would enjoy frequent,
direct rides from suburban stations through the urban core, and overall
ridership would increase as public transit becomes more convenient and reliable.
This plan envisions a 20-year roadmap that fundamentally reshapes how the region
travels, paving the way for the next era of vibrant, coordinated public
transportation in Greater Boston.",0.022006481885910034,0.7543363571166992,0.22365722060203552,0.2016507387161255

""This report is designed to be a roadmap for the Governor and legislature to
build the strongest and most equitable transportation funding package in the
country – and make the transportation system the people of Massachusetts need
and deserve a reality.""  To briefly summarize:  # Guiding Principles: What the
People of Massachusetts Really Want  * Equity * Accessibility * Safety *
Affordability * Choice * Environmental Responsibility  * Improved Public Health
# The Misconceptions that are Holding us Back  * Question 1: Why does it seem
like the MBTA has plenty of money, but is unable to spend it wisely?    * **The
MBTA and all transit systems in Massachusetts have been chronically underfunded
for decades.**       * The MBTA needs new, dedicated, consistent, and
diversified revenue streams that will appropriately fund the MBTA in the long
term.       * The MBTA has proven that it is capable of spending money
responsibly and appropriately, especially within the last 12 months.       *
Underinvesting in the short term will almost certainly cost significantly more
in the long run. * Question 2: Does the gas tax cover the costs of roads and
bridges?    * **The gas tax and other fees associated with driving only cover a
small portion of roadway costs.**       * Given the State’s climate goals, the
Commonwealth should anticipate that the gas tax will decline and disappear
entirely in the coming decades.       * The gas tax has never fully funded our
state’s roadway transportation needs. * Question 3: Do fares cover the cost of
transit?    * **Fares only cover a small portion of transit operations.
Historically, increasing fares in Massachusetts has depressed ridership and has
not meaningfully filled budget gaps.**       * Fares are an unstable and
declining revenue source.       * Increasing fares would depress ridership,
which is even more of a concern at a time when increasing transit ridership is a
statewide goal.       * Increasing fares has not historically improved service
or meaningfully closed budget gaps. * Question 4: Can Electric Vehicles alone
meet the Commonwealth’s transportation emission reduction goals?    * **Electric
Vehicles (“EVs”) are an important piece of our strategy to reduce Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) emissions, but we need to broaden the overall decarbonization approach
with a greater focus on expanding transit access.**       * Electric Vehicles
should be part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions, however; EVs
alone cannot solve other transportation problems like congestion and road
safety. Investments in transit, safer streets, and active transportation are
essential tools for solving these problems.       * Thoughtful incentives can
ensure EVs help all communities, especially those historically impacted by
pollution and high transportation costs, while actually removing gasoline
vehicles from the road. * Question 5: Are Public Private Partnerships a
sure-fire way to reduce costs for government agencies?    * **Public Private
Partnerships are not always cost-saving mechanisms and should be subject to
careful review.**       * Transportation authorities should consider where
contracting with private entities makes most sense, and to hold those
contractors accountable, but should not treat privatization through new P3s as a
strategy for reducing revenue needs.       * To maximize public benefit, and
safeguard against P3 pitfalls, we must make sure that transit agencies have the
institutional capacity to navigate the complex transactions of P3s. Agencies
should be equipped to effectively manage P3s from start to finish.       *
Massachusetts should set clearer legislative authority and parameters for P3s to
ensure that worker rights are protected and that government entities are
protected when projects are over budget, and under performing. * Question 6:
Isn’t the Fair Share Amendment going to fill the funding gaps for transportation
and education?    * **The Fair Share amendment is successfully generating new
revenue for education and transportation, but is not enough revenue to fill
revenue gaps for both.** (especially relevant given Healey's approach relying
exclusively upon it)       * Voters support increased investments in
transportation and education.       * Additional transportation funding sources
are needed, regardless of the precise division of Fair Share funds with
education.       * Transportation revenue can come from non-transportation
sources.       * Transportation funding can be raised in ways that reduce rather
than worsen inequality.  # Framework for an Equitable and Sustainable
Transportation Funding Package  * **Recommendation 1: Focus on more equitable
and sustainable revenue options first.**    * New corporate minimum tax tiers.
* Eliminating special exemptions, deductions or credits that reduce the value of
taxes on personal income or corporate profits. (Healey has been doing the
opposite since she entered office) * **Recommendation 2: Ensure low and moderate
income individuals are not overburdened with paying for the transportation
system.**    * When considering a user fee, the legislature should ask the
following:       * Does the user fee help change a behavior and/or make progress
toward a mobility, climate or public health goal? If not, then this user fee
should be off the table.       * What is the potential for disproportionate
impact on low income individuals?       * If there is a disproportionate impact,
are mitigation measures possible and reasonable to implement? * **Recommendation
3: Include policies and revenue options that allow for local and regional self
determination.**    * Regional Ballot Initiatives (RBIs)    * Transit-Oriented
Development Value Capture * **Recommendation 4: Include smart policies that will
shape a more sustainable transportation future.**    * Setting a Vehicle Miles
Traveled (VMT) reduction goal for 2050.    * Creating a plan to reduce reliance
on the gas tax and transit fares by 2050 and 2030 respectively.    * Provide
adequate resources to electrify transit statewide.  # Conclusion  Now is the
time to act on equitable and sustainable solutions to Massachusetts’
transportation funding challenges. We urge policymakers to recommit to this
work, using a framework informed by equity best practices, lessons from other
states, and, most importantly, the voices of people in communities around the
Commonwealth.   Meeting this moment means confronting long-held misperceptions
about transportation financing, exploring a variety of known and new revenue
options, and leaving behind ideas that no longer fit with our state’s long-term
vision.   The organizations involved in crafting this report look forward to
being partners in taking on these challenges together, to bring to life the

1hwekfi,The South Coast Rail will benefit a few and hurt many,"Commuter rail is notoriously finicky. It starts off well and becomes
unreliable in a year or two when the novelty wears off and everyone realizes how
much of a pain it is. Developers love it because they can play the cash grab
game with the state government and put up a bunch of cheaply slapped together
Soviet style ""luxury"" apartment buildings with the obligatory scrap ""affordable
housing"" units you need to win the Hunger Games to get into. Property values may
increase in the short term but putting an end of line commuter station in an
economicly depressed area could cause problems in the long term.   It's
difficult to see who the SCCR benefits besides landlords, developers,
politicians, and the companies contracted to build the rail itself. A lot of
people in Fall River and New Bedford will be priced out of the areas they grew
up in for a train to nowhere. Fall River is a long way from Boston. Where will
these people be commuting to? Nobody really knows until the thing is up and
running. Why didn't the MBTA focus on fixing its core service before expanding?
It looks to me like a few people are getting rich off thing and a few more stand
to become richer. The unreliable nature of MBTA commuter rail ensures ridership
will decrease after the novelty wears off. Rents will not. People will become
displaced. State mandated fake affordable housing will pop up around the areas
that will look outdated as soon as they go up and will offer nothing for your
average worker. It will only make life a little harder and more expensive for
everyone but the few who won a dystopian lottery, a few yuppies, some shady
developers and their politician friends. You can say goodbye to any character
those neighborhoods used to have as well.",-1,Outlier,-1: Outlier,"The South Coast Rail will benefit a few and hurt many Commuter rail is notoriously finicky. It starts off well and becomes

1gkhntn,Where and When is the Commuter Rail Faster,"Earlier this year WGBH tested whether the Commuter Rail or driving was faster
from Worcester. Unsurprisingly the car was faster, however it got me wondering
what stations are faster, and most importantly the experiment took place pretty
early in the morning, so what stations are faster during rush hour? I crunched
the numbers myself and here’s what I came up with using Google Maps to estimate
Station-to-Station travel times when set to arrive at 6:50AM and 8:50AM. I also
estimated how a “Modernized” Commuter Rail would compare, based on reports by
the advocacy group TransitMatters. A link to the calculations is attached below,
I’m sure I’ve made some errors in there. I’ll talk more about the methodology
below.

Note: “Local” and “Express” don’t need to be literal, simply different service
patterns with significant time savings. Super Express does refer to the
Worcester-Framingham-Boston Landing express service.    More details and other
thoughts:  Commuter Rail Travel Time: This was taken from the schedule,
primarily over the summer on weekdays. Instead of just taking the most relevant
scheduled train (closest arrival time to 6:50/8:50) I wanted to look
holistically and averaged together travel times within a few minutes or
identified faster alternate service patterns and assessed those differently. If
there was a split, like 54m, 50m, 42m, 38m the first two would be averaged as
one service pattern, and the latter two as another, with both being reported on
the map if relevant.   Driving Travel Times: I have driven very little in Boston
and especially the suburbs so I have no frame of reference as to whether
Google’s estimates are realistic, if you have experience with these trips let me
know! Google provided a range and I took the mean, although its possible that
the typical driving time is skewed toward one end of that range instead. This
data was collected throughout several weekdays during the summer.  Modernized
Commuter Rail: The advocacy group TransitMatters has released reports on
modernizing the Commuter Rail over the past few years that feature
electrification, level-boarding, and some track improvements to decrease travel
times. I’ve taken their proposed travel times and calculated the percent
decrease (based on the current travel times they list in the reports) for the
termini and applied that to the entire relevant branch. For the Needham branch I
applied the time savings from the Fairmount Line. This approach is overly
simplified and probably overstates the benefits. Additionally, TransitMatters’s
reports are probably on the optimistic end for what we might really see.  The
Last Mile Problem: Most people don’t live at a Commuter Rail station and work at
North/South Station, and they tend to include some buffer, so they don’t miss
the train, but since every scenario is different I think using
Station-to-Station travel times is a sensible baseline. The 15-minute faster

I cannot help but think about the Federal Transit Administration's Safety
Management Inspection of the MBTA. On transit a single death and a few safety
incidents is treated as unacceptable, requiring mitigation and direct efforts to
address, as it should be. I was worried about safety theater and hollowing out
service under Baker (I think that was founded and his orange line shut down was
a joke), but under Eng these requirements seem to really be helping make transit
better. They worked that way in DC too.      Anyway, what would happen if we
treated this constant litany of incidents on our roadways the same way? would we
even have highways at all? What if deaths on the roadway or identified danger
areas resulted in speed restrictions and systemic investigations in order to
improve safety? What if this was covered as a problem with our roadways at all,
rather than asa series of isolated incidents usually blamed on individuals?

attract new dollars, and curry political favor to avert a financial crisis, but
fare increases are not yet on the table. Nor are they off the menu.  “Increases
in fares — in general — is something that is always discussed,” MBTA General
Manager Phillip Eng said during an interview at the 2024 Globe Summit. Later in
the discussion referring to fare increases, he added: “Those are things we have
to look at.”  The MBTA is facing a looming budget crisis next year that will
take hundreds of millions of dollars to avert. Still, Eng emphasized that he
would seek grants and other assistance from federal agencies and push employees
to work more efficiently, emphasizing cost-cutting measures over fare increases.
He also made it clear that he doesn’t think fares can solve the problem.  “You
cannot fund the T on the backs of riders and the public,” Eng said. “Quite
frankly, it would be unaffordable if we tried to fund the T strictly on fares.”
Currently, about 19 percent of the T’s expenses are covered by fares, with the
remainder coming from sales taxes, local assessments, federal funds, and other
external   Eng also said he would “continue dialogue” with the White House and
federal agencies to alleviate the T’s deficit, emphasizing that transportation
authorities across the country are in similar dire financial straits. Though Eng
didn’t outright deny that fares would increase as a result of the looming
financial crisis, he said the MBTA must keep fares affordable.  “What we are
trying to do is make sure it’s safe, reliable and affordable, so even if those
discussions are had, it has to be what is affordable for folks, given the rising

left riders in darkness on Tuesday, MBTA General Manager Phil Eng answered

service to grind to a halt on the Blue, Green, Orange and Red lines. Trains were
ordered to stand by at stations.  Video from passengers showed trains stopped
beside darkened platforms. Riders also said that air conditioning was stopped.
""There was a power surge outside of system but right near our operations center
it did affect all of our lines and all of our signals,"" Eng said on Wednesday.
After power was restored, signal problems continued to slow the return to full
service.  ""When the signals go dark and when the signals are out of
correspondence, it means we have to supplement with a lot of manual operations,""
Eng said. ""And the time to get people in place to do that was lengthy,
unfortunately.""  While Eng said the power surge originated outside of the MBTA's
system, he was still waiting on Wednesday for more information about the cause.

similar surges in the future.  ""I know it inconvenienced people as they got

1dycou8,"The Red Line Will be Shut Down Between Alewife and Kendall from July 13-28, being extended to Park St on evenings and Weekends.","# Why?  This shutdown is being executed to remove slow zones and do station
maintenance. There are currently **11 speed restrictions** between Kendall and
Alewife. They plan to **remove 9-10 of them**. This will result in round trip
**travel times being cut by at least 4 minutes.**    # What Are The
Alternatives?  **Shuttle Buses**  3 shuttle bus routes will run:  * Local
Shuttles making stops at all closed stations * Express shuttle buses making
stops at Alewife, Porter, and Kendall * A shuttle bus loop serving Harvard,
Central, and Kendall, before going back to Harvard (it's unclear if this will
serve Central Outbound)     **Regular Bus:**  * Route 77 will be free withing
Cambrige. This is a key bus route, with frequent service. It stops between
Alewife and Davis, and at Porter before terminating at Harvard * Route 83 will
**NOT** be fare free, but it stops at Alewife and Porter before terminating at
Central.    **Commuter Rail:**  * The Fitchburg Line will be fare free between
Porter and North Station. Trains will be running **every 30 minutes** on
weekdays, and **every 2 hours on weekends.**     **Community Path:**  * The
Somerville Community Path connects Davis and Magoun Square Stations (it's less
than 20 minutes from Magoun Square to Park Street). This section of path is just
under a mile, and is a really nice walk or bike ride, as you don't have to deal
with much traffic. The path and Alewife Linear park also extend out to Alewife.
**Reminder: The Green Line Extension will be CLOSED on July 13-14.**    # Notes:
* The shuttle buses and regular buses will likely be very crowded and slow. If
you can walk, bike, or take the Commuter Rail, please do, so that space can be
made for seniors or people with disabilities who have no choice but to use the
buses. * **PLAN FOR EXTRA TIME.** Again, the shuttle buses and regular buses
will be VERY SLOW, and likely so crowded that you have to wait as multiple buses
go by in order to get on one. This will especially be a problem closer to
downtown. * The GLX will be closed on July 13-14, nixing some alternatives. * If
there are any questions, I will do my best to answer them.    # Sources/Further

turned. He appeared to be a homeless man, and I accidentally made brief eye
contact--it was hard not to, he was very close, and had startled me. I looked
away, and did not say anything. He asked me if I was going to hit him, and I
moved away. He then followed me to the Silver Line while repeatedly threatening
to ""knock all my teeth out"". He followed me onto the Silver Line.  He then got
off at the same station I did (Courthouse), and continued to follow me
aggressively while threatening to knock all my teeth out. Of course, I wouldn't
have gotten off the Silver Line (and would've called 911) had I known he was
going to continue to follow me, but I didn't know/think that he would. There
weren't many people in the station (just some young high-schooler-age-looking
people who didn't look like they would help), so it was alarming.  Fortunately,
there was an MBTA employee nearby the top of the escalator. I explained what was
happening, and the employee walked me up to the street. The aggressive man
followed at a distance. The employee told me to keep going, and that he would
stop the man. The aggressive man started to follow, and the MBTA employee
stopped him. I looked back a few times to make sure the MBTA employee was not
being assaulted (he wasn't), and hurried to work.  I reported this to MBTA
security. I was advised that I should've been more confident and empathetic, and
tried to talk to the man and explain that I did not have a problem with him. I'm
not a city person, and Boston is new to me, but I thought the correct approach
was to *not* engage and to move away?  Some more context: I'm a short male, have
to dress well for my new job, and do probably look like an easy target. The man
seemed to be on drugs.  Questions:  * Is the MBTA security officer's advice
sound, or should I not engage? * Should I have called 911 when I realized how
serious the situation was in Courthouse Station? Or would that have made things
worse, and resulted in a too-slow-to-help response from police anyway? * Is
going from South Station to Courthouse (Seaport) a dangerous route? I've been
told that it was a relatively safe route and that the Seaport is a relatively
safe area, especially during the morning/day. * What else should I have done
differently?  Thank you in advance for the advice.  **Edit:** Thank you so much

1de50zp,"MBTA is 'barely treading water', may begin doing major cut of MBTA service in 2026 (via CommonBeacon)","TLDR: The MBTA has tons of projects it simply does not have the money to
currently fund, such as the SL3 Extension to Everett and Sullivan, redesign of
the JFK/UMass station, the Red-Blue connector, etc. If the MBTA does not close
the now 700 million dollar deficit by next year for fiscal year 2026, it will
have to consider cutting MBTA service like what was proposed in 2021. The
financial issue can be contributed to the sales tax revenue not growing to what
was predicted (2.29 percent now versus ~6.5-8.5 percent predicted) and
decreasing fare collections/monthly passes and ridership.   MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF ARTICLE:  The MBTA’ board of directors has signed off on a $3 billion budget,
as well as a capital investment plan, keeping the public transit agency’s
flickering lights on in the coming fiscal year starting July 1. The fiscal 2025
budget, which is 11 percent higher than the previous fiscal year, was infused
with spending from reserves to close a funding gap and help pay for a hiring
spree.  But it’s the next fiscal year, 2026 – along with the projects the agency
hasn’t been able to invest in – that drew concern from board members as they met
Tuesday.  “We have 13 months to figure out how we’re going to solve the problem”
of a $700 million funding gap for the T, said Tom Glynn, a former T general
manager who now chairs the oversight board.  Otherwise, the agency will be
forced to consider massive service cuts. “Cutting of service is not going to
solve our problems. In fact it’ll send us in the wrong direction,” said Phil
Eng, the T’s current general manager. “We’re going to keep making the case to
fund the T. The economy and public life thrives with mass transportation, and I
think others who are going to help us solve this are fully aware of the need to
find a way to support our needs.”  Sales tax revenue “grossly underperformed
expectations” over the last two decades, hitting an average annual growth rate
of 2.29 percent rather than the 6.46 to 8.50 percent, according to a
presentation from T staff. That amounts to between $8.9 to $15.5 billion in lost
revenue, and as Brian Kane, executive director of MBTA’s advisory board, put it,
the agency has been left “holding the bag.”  Separately, ridership appears to
have plateaued, and fare revenue remains at roughly 60 percent of pre-pandemic
levels. Riders have also shifted away from monthly passes and moved to storing
value on their CharlieCards and single tickets. (Pre-pandemic, half of fare
revenue came from monthly passes.)  The MBTA’s board also signed off on a
five-year capital budget, totaling $9.6 billion and covering 640 projects. The
list includes replacement of a 1930s drawbridge by North Station, bridge fixes,
repairs to stairs and lighting at various stations, and new buses, among others.
But the unfunded projects – not included in the capital budget “despite their

currently fund, such as the SL3 Extension to Everett and Sullivan, redesign of
the JFK/UMass station, the Red-Blue connector, etc. If the MBTA does not close
the now 700 million dollar deficit by next year for fiscal year 2026, it will
have to consider cutting MBTA service like what was proposed in 2021. The
financial issue can be contributed to the sales tax revenue not growing to what
was predicted (2.29 percent now versus ~6.5-8.5 percent predicted) and
decreasing fare collections/monthly passes and ridership.   MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF ARTICLE:  The MBTA’ board of directors has signed off on a $3 billion budget,
as well as a capital investment plan, keeping the public transit agency’s
flickering lights on in the coming fiscal year starting July 1. The fiscal 2025
budget, which is 11 percent higher than the previous fiscal year, was infused
with spending from reserves to close a funding gap and help pay for a hiring
spree.  But it’s the next fiscal year, 2026 – along with the projects the agency
hasn’t been able to invest in – that drew concern from board members as they met
Tuesday.  “We have 13 months to figure out how we’re going to solve the problem”
of a $700 million funding gap for the T, said Tom Glynn, a former T general
manager who now chairs the oversight board.  Otherwise, the agency will be
forced to consider massive service cuts. “Cutting of service is not going to
solve our problems. In fact it’ll send us in the wrong direction,” said Phil
Eng, the T’s current general manager. “We’re going to keep making the case to
fund the T. The economy and public life thrives with mass transportation, and I
think others who are going to help us solve this are fully aware of the need to
find a way to support our needs.”  Sales tax revenue “grossly underperformed
expectations” over the last two decades, hitting an average annual growth rate
of 2.29 percent rather than the 6.46 to 8.50 percent, according to a
presentation from T staff. That amounts to between $8.9 to $15.5 billion in lost
revenue, and as Brian Kane, executive director of MBTA’s advisory board, put it,
the agency has been left “holding the bag.”  Separately, ridership appears to
have plateaued, and fare revenue remains at roughly 60 percent of pre-pandemic
levels. Riders have also shifted away from monthly passes and moved to storing
value on their CharlieCards and single tickets. (Pre-pandemic, half of fare
revenue came from monthly passes.)  The MBTA’s board also signed off on a
five-year capital budget, totaling $9.6 billion and covering 640 projects. The
list includes replacement of a 1930s drawbridge by North Station, bridge fixes,
repairs to stairs and lighting at various stations, and new buses, among others.
But the unfunded projects – not included in the capital budget “despite their
importance to the MBTA’s strategic goals – also drew the attention of board
members, as did the $24 billion needed to bring the system’s assets into a state
of good repair. The unfunded projects include an overhaul of the JFK Red Line
Station, accessibility improvements to the Orange Line’s Chinatown Station, a

1audncn,Harvard to Alewife express trains NOT a solution to bunching problems on Red Line,"In order to solve bunching problems on the Red Line, the MBTA is sometimes
running express trains from Harvard to Alewife, without stopping at Porter and
Davis. I was on one today, and the conductor spent 3 additional minutes at
Harvard going to every car, making sure that passengers for Porter and Davis had
left the train. Since 3 minutes is equivalent to the time saved by not stopping
at Porter and Davis, these express trains are not only disruptive for passengers

of people who waited almost 30+ for a train. Running trains more often will
allow people to use the CR without having to base their schedule around it.  The
North-South Link is also something I find really interesting because connecting
the two could be a game changer (especially with North Station being under TD
Garden). I do not know if rails would be the most affordable option if the T
implements a SL line connecting the two (possibly SL6?).  Electrification is
something that is also vital to transforming the system. If the T or Keolis can
electrify the entire system and bring in new trains it would make journeys more
enjoyable.  Finally, expanding the CR into NH and Western Mass will allow people
who normally had no access to transit to now have it and may even allow the T to
gain more support statewide in terms of increasing funding for other projects.",25,"infrastructure, stations, metrolink, platforms, corridor, planning, track, concrete, tunnel, electrification","25: infrastructure, stations, metrolink, platforms, corridor, planning, track, concrete, tunnel, electrification","Let’s talk about the Commuter Rail: how can we plan for its’ future?

afternoon and forced some riders to walk along the tracks after a problem with
the overhead electrical system, according to a tweet from the agency and a

the overhead electrical system.   &gt;   &gt;Shuttle buses were replacing

be on the lookout for this (especially if you go through Ashmont in the

1aeegyj,Making this post since some people seem to not understand WHY the T breaks down so often.,"A lot of people have been complaining about the Green Line today (and saw a post
about fare evading), so I decided to make this post so people can better
understand WHY these delays happen.  The defunding of the T first started under
Gov. Weld and Baker (the same Baler who would become Governor himself). They
used money that was originally supposed to be used for the T and instead used it
for the Big Dig. Since then, many of the governors we have had continued this
pattern or defunding.  In addition, many GMs until Eng simply glossed over the
track decay that was happening or did not have the staff or funds to actually
fix the tracks. As this continued to happen, the issues with old trains (which
will inevitably break down due to time) began to grow because the T had no
support to get new trains.  This has basically led to the current system we have
today, where headways are over 10-15+ minutes and train breakdowns are common.
Now, before complaining/bit**ing about the T, please understand:  1.) Do not be
mad at the T or their workers; many of them use the T themselves and are just as
annoyed as you are. They are people and deserve respect.  2. ) Be mad at the
state for not doing enough to support the T, financially and otherwise. Healey,
for example, is only increasing funds to ~50 million dollars for a system that
will need 24 billion dollars to bring the system to a state of good repair AND
is facing a financial cliff next year (basically, the T will have no extra money
to run anything).  3. ) Instead of making fun of the T, email the Governor.
Email Mayor Wu and other mayors services by the T. Support transit
organizations. Make your voice heard.  (BTW, shoutout to BeautifulGlove for all
of their work to provide more information about the T. You are a real one.)",52,"trolley, track, frustrations, infrastructure, service, annoyed, issues, complaining, governors, support","52: trolley, track, frustrations, infrastructure, service, annoyed, issues, complaining, governors, support","Making this post since some people seem to not understand WHY the T breaks down so often.

not? * Is there a pattern to what trains stop at Hyde Park? From what I've
gathered Franklin/Foxboro Line trains sometimes stop going outbound, but never
inbound, and Stoughton Trains always stop when going inbound, but usually not
outbound, and Providence Trains rarely stop, except on weekends when they always
do.   * Again, what the actual fuck   And now I need advice from people in

only * Limited service * ~~Limited service except weekends~~ * Short turns:

two stations (Northbound, 253 feet at 25 mph). * Last weekend, the entire GLX
was shut down for work. Many of the new slow zones might be related to said
work. What we do know is that they were working on **rail and tie replacement on
the Lechmere viaduct**, which should allow them to **remove or shorten the slow

with every update the MBTA decides to give us). **After two or three of them, I
take ALL of the information from them** and make a larger post here on r/mbta. I

Slow Zones lengthened:  * Southbound Sullivan to Community College: added 700
feet at 10 mph. * Eastbound Science Park to Lechmere: added 300 feet, **reduced
to 3 mph**. * Westbound Copley to Hynes: added 500 feet, **reduced to 3 mph.**

* Work will be done between JFK and North Quincy during weeknight shutdowns of
the stretch (June 26-29). This is the last of a series of diversions known to
the public, **suggesting that they are finishing up work on removing or
shortening those slow zones.** * **Punch list work is being wrapped up between
Tufts Medical Center and Back Bay** to remove the last slow zone between those
two stations (Northbound, 253 feet at 25 mph). * Last weekend, the entire GLX
was shut down for work. Many of the new slow zones might be related to said
work. What we do know is that they were working on **rail and tie replacement on
the Lechmere viaduct**, which should allow them to **remove or shorten the slow
zones on the viaduct** in the next week or two. As for the other slow zones on
the GLX, we don't know if they worked on them over the last weekend. Only time
will tell. * **The B branch of the Green Line will be shut down between July 17
and 28** for track replacement necessary to remove multiple slow zones in the
area. * Most of the information in this post can also be found on [my
profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chemical-Glove-1435) in ""little"" slow zone
updates. These updates are smaller, and are posted more frequently (essentially
with every update the MBTA decides to give us). **After two or three of them, I
take ALL of the information from them** and make a larger post here on r/mbta. I
thought that this was a good compromise between tiny and often updates here,
(which were probably quite annoying), and not updating you peeps for several
days. So, if you want more frequent updates, with all of the same information,
please go check out [my

with wooden sleepers and was pretty upset with the manufacturer.  Other
passenger railroads like Amtrak use concrete on the NEC with little Issue to my
knowledge and the LIRR somewhat recently refitted portions of its network to
using concrete.   I’ve come to understand that concrete enjoys numerous
advantages over wood and other materials. Advantages such as enabling higher
speeds, requiring less maintenance, it’s overall strength, and it’s sometimes
cheaper to purchase. It seems like the T just got unlucky. Are there good

through the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make ""essential

their support of the many years of hard work and collaboration between Everett,
the MBTA, and many others that culminated in the awarding of this grant that
will bring rapid transit to Everett. Bus Rapid Transit along the Broadway
corridor will most importantly improve the daily commutes of thousands of
Everett residents and provide them with greater access to education and
employment options,"" [Everett Mayor] DeMaria said in a statement to the State
House News Service. ""This grant also will provide for expanded public and
multi-modal transportation options that support redevelopment opportunities such
as a potential professional soccer stadium that will uplift Everett and the
region while mitigating concerns about additional congestion from such
projects.""  “The MBTA is grateful for this major federal award for the Lower
Broadway Everett Transit Priority Corridor Project, which prioritizes safety and
will improve the commutes of thousands of our bus riders and the Everett
community as a whole through newly constructed bus-only lanes and bus stops,
fully separated bicycle facilities, improved pedestrian amenities, transit
signal priority, and enhanced accessibility along the 1.2-mile Lower Broadway
